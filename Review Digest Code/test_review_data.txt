1|The Galaxy 5 smartphone I have is unfortunately a piece of junk.  The phone keeps shutting off.  I then need to take the cover off, slide out the battery, put it back together and then restart the phone.  I take very good care of the things that I have but the cover is now chipped in three spots due to being removed so much.  Sprint won't replace the phone and neither will Samsung as I have contacted them twice.  I will not ever purchase another Samsung phone due to this.  Next time it is LG or Apple.  I am clearly disappointed with both the service that I have received from both Sprint and Samsung.|on December 12, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

7|Great condition (virtually perfect), popped in SIM from old phone and everything worked out of the box, zero hassle and zero fuss. Had a bit of concern with battery life the first week or so, but it seems like the power management needs a week to fine tune itself-- battery life has gotten much better after that. Only reminder is that the included charger with a used phone is a low-end 5W (5V/1A) thing, you'll want to purchase a modern 5V/2.4A charger for optimal performance.|on December 10, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
8|so first off i just had to return a refurbished phone because it was still active in the other person's account. That by itself was annoying but the phone charging port clip that's used to keep water out was snapped off plus the charger it came with was broken. i think i might try my luck again and see if i get a functioning phone. if that one works fine i'll change this review but yea i frustrated i was really excited to use the phone. Amazon still has good customer service.|on December 10, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars
9|I took a chance buying a refurbished S5 from pangea_deals about a month ago because I wanted a Galaxy phone without paying the price for the newest model. I had an S3 several years ago that ran on Sprint. Alas, when I switched to an ATT GoPhone plan, I bought a cheap off-brand phone. I started regretting that purchase almost immediately after buying, but I was saving so much money per month with the pre-paid plan that I just muddled through. I have never purchased a refurbished phone before, but my experience with this product has been so positive that I bought a refurbished S6 for my mom from pangea_deals. I'm going to focus my review on the fact that this is a refurbished phone. I'm not going to review the S5 itself because I think Samsung phones sell themselves. Pros: - All the great software and capabilities you'd expect from a Galaxy phone - Phone arrived with minimal cosmetic damage, just like the product description - Phone arrived very quickly, within 4 days of purchase - Works perfectly with my GoPhone SIM card. All I had to do was insert the SIM card into the slot. No trips to the ATT store Cons: - Phone arrived with a cheap screen protector that I immediately peeled off. Not a big deal. Overall, I liked this purchase enough to buy a refurbished S6 from pangea_deals as well, and I'd recommend this seller to others.|on December 10, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
10|My wife, a long time iphone devotee, got this phone because she wanted something new. Stupid phone uses battery like crazy, she doesnt even want extra batteries because she prefers to just take my iphone 5. Despite larger screen on samsung, she doent like it dt its noticeably slower, we have both noticed that she is on the phone much less for multimedia. I wish theyd make this phone better so I could get my iphone back!!!|on December 9, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars
11|I had a previous version of this phone which I liked better.  This new version is so bloated with apps and software that I don't want, there is not enough memory left.  I even bought an SD card to move some things off the phone to make room; but the phone does not allow many things to be moved!  This is too big brother for me.  Next phone, I resent the fact that I will have to pay for more memory to accommodate having programs I don't even want.|on December 9, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

14|The phone itself is decent. The problem is Verizon. It's not the network that's bad, its the support for the phone. The software for their S5 is behind other major carriers in updating.  It contains a number of bugs and has issues with the battery and memory and Verizon refuses to adress when fixes are coming. Updates for security flaws coming from Samsung which are being released monthly are not being pushed through. Skip this phone and go get a Nexus 5x or 6p and bypass Verizon's support.|on December 8, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars
15|I recently bought the S5 for my upgrade and am very happy with my purchase. With phones these days it always seems like your model is old and outdated a week after you get it. I do not feel this way with the S5. I've outlined some pros and cons of things I find important below. Pros: 1. It's android, I personally prefer the android over apple for the flexibility and interface. 2. The battery life is great! I have been able to run 2 days with moderate usage on one charge. 3. The camera is really nice. With 16MP the details are great! I took this on a road trip and ended up using the camera quite a bit more than i thought. 4. USB 3.0 and 2.0. I have my old micro USB charger and was worried I wouldn't be able to use it but it still fits! 5. Screen size is nice. I can see and read things on the screen much easier than my old phone. Cons: 1. It was actually hard to find cons but the increased size makes it difficult to fit in some of my pockets. 2. It may be the size or the background noise reduction but some people have had trouble hearing me when the phone is not positioned properly. 3. The front camera isn't amazing but still works fine for self portraits. 4. I hardly use any default apps and they just seem to take up space. Overall, the pros are superior to the cons and I feel like I have a great phone that will last me quite some time. Very pleased with the purchase.|on December 8, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

18|I have used this phone for the past couple years, its the only phone out right now that gives you access to the battery, sd card for additional storage AND water resistance up to 3 feet in water!!!! It is 2015 and this phone is STILL the best phone you can buy with the most useful features. Samsung ruined themselves with the Galaxy s6, which was a huge downgrade go with this galaxy s5 instead! Also Ive taken this phone into pools, water parks, showers etc. and it has lasted through everything.

25|We have always purchased our phones from the Verizon store. I was very skeptical about buying online, especially a used cell phone.

The phone is an amazing deal for the price!|on December 4, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

She is in need of a new phone ad S5 will be perfect.  She is a dog groomer and having a phone water resistant is a plus. I didn't update it to lollipop yet. It is so new it is still running kit kat.

28|It was a bit misadvertised. On the original post it stated that it had scratches and small dings but when it arrived I found no scratches or dings whatsoever. The battery on the other hand was a bit old but that was an easy fix because I purchased another battery for backup.|on December 2, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
29|I had been using a Samsung Galaxy S3 but had horrible reception where I live. I noticed that a different Samsung phone had better reception and also got a 4G signal, which I had never gotten with my S3. So I ordered this S5 refurbished. It arrived today. First thing I did was charge the battery. Once that was done I transferred the SIM card and 64G SD card into the new phone and turned it on. After a few minutes of setup it was off and running. I have more bars than before and it shows a 3G signal. I was a little nervous about buying a refurbished phone, but it came with a protective film over the screen and there was not a mark on it anywhere. It looked like new. I should add that using the NFC I was able to transfer a bunch of stuff from the old phone (even without the SIM card in it) to the new one. One concern I had was the new S5 has a different power port from the S3. But I learned that the old micro USB plug can fit into the new port. But using the new charge cable that came with the phone charges it faster. I could not be more pleased.|on December 1, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

32|Beware amazon is selling the international unlocked version of this phone. Phone developed a hairline crack on screen through normal use. This issue is known and Samsung US honors their phones for repair of the issue. Amazon in incorrectly selling the international version prevents this issue from being repaired by Samsung US. If you are unwilling to take the risk of getting an international product with no support seek other sources.|on November 29, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

38|I've previously owned the s3, which I loved. With this being 2 generations newer, one would think its performance will be obviously improved.  Not  so.  The phone overheats easily when streaming music and using GPS in the car, threatening to shut down all the apps.  It can lead you to get lost without your trusty Google maps.  It's very frustrating.  And it's unacceptable the way it lags and freezes up so frequently.  Although I'm a heavy user, that cannot be the cause since it also happens to my sis, who only uses its basic features.  I am losing confidence in Samsung products. Less than a year old, and I'm seriously considering getting a new phone.  Next time, I'm getting a Nexus.|on November 24, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

The screen is so clear, pictures are incredible, video is awesome, streaming movies is great, internet searches and downloading applications from the play store are very fast on this phone.

46|Everything is great about this phone expect the material that it's made up of - glass and plastic!  The cell phone angels saved me on a couple accidental drops when the phone landed face first on the ground and even completely submerged underwater - it WAS waterproof!  Then getting out of my car one day the phone was sitting on top of a smooth flat surface (book); as soon as I fully extend my second leg the phone slides off the book at a 45 degree angle and hits the pavement with a good couple pounds of force.  The resulting magnitudinal impact destroyed the overall aesthetic appeal of the phone's full LCD touchscreen, waterproof-ability and ability to take selfies.  Call me crazy, high maintenance, whatever, but I expect a little more forgiveness when it comes to high-cost products that are designed to be mobile.|on November 20, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

59|good phone. has great features however, it started giving out 2 months after purchase. first, the screen would freeze and I had to take the battery out in order for it to work. then, the earphone plug stopped working and I couldn't listen to music unless it was over the loud speaker and finally- I can't hear anyone on the phone unless I put it on speaker and even then it comes out muffled and the person of the other end always tells me it sound like I'm breaking up and they can only hear bits and pieces of what I'm saying. really loved my s3 and s4 so I wanted to go ahead and give this one a shot and that was the biggest mistake. don't waste your money or make sure you have insurance.|on November 14, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

65|I bought the Spring S5. Although the place I got the phone from was wonderful, the Sprint Spark network does not allow you to multitask at all. I had this phone for 1 day before I had to switch back to my S4. You cannot use any data while on the phone, unless connected to wireless. When driving and using my GPS, if someone called, my GPS would continue only if I stayed on the predetermined route. If I deviated from the route whatsoever it would freeze. For people who do not need to be able to use multiple functions at once, this might not be a problem, but for people like me that are always on the go, this is a major no go. My S4 functions just fine, and minus the slightly worse graphics, it just as good as the S5.|on November 11, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

89|I have an S5 through AT&T as my work provided phone and an S5 through VZW as my personal phone. On my VZW phone, which this order was for, every time Facebook updates, the entire phone force closes every app that is currently open, resets the wallpaper to stock and reverts back to the home screen. My AT&T S5 does not do this. The home screens also do not rotate all the way around 360 degrees like my AT&T S5 does, because Verizon disabled this feature. I'm guessing because they want some other app to do this? Who knows, carrier specific changes to Android don't make sense to the consumer. Otherwise, it's about what I expected. It has a fair quick response time between apps/home screen, phone camera is pretty decent, easy to close any open and orphaned apps, the pedometer and heart rate monitor are nice features and I like unlocking my phone with a quick swipe of my thumb. This was the last GSx phone to have removable/expandable memory as of late 2015, so I may have to jump ship as a loyal Samsung mobile user if new Galaxy phones continue to force the user to use Cloud backup.|on November 2, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

93|I have had this phone for a year now.  At first it was ok but within the first few months it started locking up.  Now when sending text messages it locks up so bad, the phone will double every word I type.  If someone is sending me a text at the same time I'm trying to type one, forget it.  May as well wait until they are done because it locks up and you have to wait several minutes before you can even type anything.  I replied to a group text earlier, my text went to the group then it went to every person individually who was in the group text message.  Most of the time when I send a text, it will send the same message two or three times.  Last week, someone sent me a text message then my phone went nuts.  I kept receiving text messages from "unknown number" with an "unknown message". I received these from 10 pm at night all the way until 5 am the next morning.  I didn't even know it until I woke up and saw I had 37 unread text messages.  Luckily I had my sound turned off.  The battery is terrible.  I have to leave it plugged into the charger the entire day and I'm not even using it then it's already dead in the morning.  This had the potential to be a really great phone but Samsung dropped the ball.  So tired of dealing with the slowness, locking up, and glitches that I'm considering switching to iPhone and I love Androids!|on October 30, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

105|This model is not the most recent, but it was way newer than my flip phone.  Because this was "like new"  (and it was),  it was back to square 1 for  software revisions,  so the first week you have to be willing to load  new firmware, operating systems, and a zillion aps.  Once this has settled down,  you have decent phone.  Then ,  there are things to change, setup, erase,  and otherwise configure for YOU.  Reminder that this phone is larger than older smartphones.  The battery might last 2 days, so charging nightly is suggested. The camera is OK.|on October 24, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

118|I ordered my samsung galaxy s5 through amazon wear house. I selected used-like new. I received my phone the next day in perfect condition. Everything came nicely packaged. I put my Sims card in, then plugged in the phone and booted it up. The phones operating system ran smooth. Everything works and runs grate and smooth with no lag. The camera is definitely something to brag about. Overall great experience with my samsung galaxy s5.|on October 15, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

124|I recently got this phone a few days ago and I gotta say that this phone was an excellent buy! The phone has many great and new features that makes this phone a great buy! The only complaint I have is that the phone isn't really designed for speed but instead is designed in a even area between speed and aesthetics.

136|This phone has some useful features like an IR transmitter for remote controlling TVs or appliances and the fingerprint reader which makes unlocking the phone faster and easier.  However, I've noticed(on my phone at least) there must be a partition in the internal memory allotted for the installation of apps only as it keeps telling me I ran out of space even though the storage manager says I have 400 MB available in the internal memory.  To add more space I've tried uninstalling apps I don't use, wiping the cache(sometimes works), and moving apps to the SD card but nothing works. I found apps in the Play Store which can manipulate the size of partitions but they work for root only.|on October 9, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

142|Worst phone I've owned. I ordered this the week they launched, had it from the very start,. After 6 months, it was constantly crashing, constanly glitching, constantly freezing. It's awful. Easy to use, great functionality, great features, but Samsung really dropped the ball on this phone. They were too focused on the next phone to overcharge people for and not fixing the bugs on this one.|on October 7, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

146|I have had this phone for 14 months and now the  iPhone 6s is out but the s5 still has a better camera and I have any app and customization I want on it with no problem. Get a lifeproof case or otterbox and you will be good. A friend of mine had the s6 and it even lost some features like the fingerprint scanner.  S5 will be great if you just need something to perform well with any amount of apps open pretty much and still be fast. I've had well over 100 tabs open in Chrome and still performed perfectly.|on October 6, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
147|This cell phone is the worst I have ever had for battery life and sound quality!  The battery life is awful; I rarely use the phone but I still have to charge it every other day! If I do use it to make phone calls and text then I have to charge it every day! And that is not even using data!  Plus, when making a phone call, I cannot understand a single thing being said unless I put it on speaker phone. Without speaker phone, it is WAY too quite; but the speaker phone isn't much better, it's louder but not clear at all!|on October 5, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

The camera takes great pictures and videos. It has better grapics than my old digital camera. The one thing I don't like are all the preloaded apps that can't be deleated.

162|It's a typical android and samsung phone (and no I'm not a fanboy of any of the phone os's or manufacturers. They're all pretty much like this). That means tons of pointless apps on the app store that are poorly done, the hardware specs mean nothing because the apps aren't optimized and way too many features. If you want to get a decent battery life out of this phone, you have to disable most of the features. No one uses half of the features on these phones let alone need them. How hard is it to pause a video by touching the screen instead of looking away? To use the phone you have to be able to touch the screen so why does this exist? The fingerprint scanner almost always takes multiple attempts to finally unlock the phone. It's a good designed phone if you're 7 feet tall and can palm a watermelon, otherwise you will at some point be required to hold it 2 handed just to use. Somehow we've had smartphones for years, every company boasts about fancy new cpu speed and ram in their phones every year, and every year they still don't totally work right. The only reason I can see people wanting a phone with a large screen is watching movies, but for half the price of a new phone like this you could get a decent tv, a streaming device and a phone that has just as many problems. You also are forced to constantly close any app you use to save on battery life and even then, the app actually stays running in the background until you go into the settings and force stop the app. Now to the good points: If you turn on the super power saving mode, it will go black and white, almost everything will be disabled and your battery will last quite a while. Samsung galaxy s series phones are like having a hunting rifle with a tactical flashlight, a scope, another scope on the bottom (I guess if you plan to shoot it upside down), a bayonet, a laser sight, an air horn, a strobe light and a cell phone all attached to the barrel.|on September 28, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

171|I have always been an Apple person. After using this phone for a couple of weeks, I am now a Galaxy fan. This phone does everything my Iphone 6 did and more, and has a larger screen. This was a pre-owned product so I did not know what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised at the condition it was in. In the description, it said it would have scuffs and scratches, this phone looked brand new. The charger that came with it is not a Samsung product, but it works just fine. I like that this phone is designed to be water resistant  (water killed my Iphone 6) and how versatile the android operating system is. Great product.|on September 24, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

189|Samsung has fallen behind in product design. This phone feels cheap straight away. I know people rave about the removable back however this does not make a premium device.

192|TIP:  To transfer your data to new phone. Download Samsung Smart Switch from Samsung on current (old) android phone AND on new phone (both). Lay both phones next to each other (within 2 to 4 inches) Open Smart Switch on each phone, put old phone as 'sending phone' and new phone as 'receiving phone' Press connect.  Once connected it will start transferring your data (really cool). Takes about 30 minutes (+/-) depending on how much data you have.  Only thing that doesn't transfer is memos/notes that I can see.  If you're using Samsung phones and they are not connecting, pick up and tap them back to back and then mine connected.|on September 14, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

202|I upgraded from the Galaxy S3 and I am very pleased with this phone, the more I mess around with it the more I like it. Apps like S Health are now more focused than ever and the heart rate sensor is great thing even though tech reviewers try to play it off as a gimmick - this phone has literally made me want to be more active since I purchased it, the biometric scanner is a great addition as well that works perfectly for me 8/10 times. Also great news is that upon typing this I found out that micro usb chargers still work with this phone (it's a USB 3.0 port that can also use a micro usb). No BS Apple move. The feel of the phone is the best of the series. Yes it's plastic but it is definitely more upscale feeling to the touch while maintaining a light weight, and aesthetically both the front and back look great. The screen is the best I've ever seen on a smartphone, crisp, colorful, and bright. The camera is an important feature for me and I'm happy to say it doesn't disappoint - it...

209|After 2 weeks with the Samsung Galaxy S5, here is a *short* review for those thinking about upgrading. *Note I switched from an iphone 4S running IOS 6* Looks: The phone is very aesthetically pleasing. Though it is still a plastic casing, it does not feel cheap by any means. The dimpled back plate provides a great grip, making single handed operation easy. It is as sleek as it is sexy. The chrome edges are slightly raised providing screen protection that apple really should look into considering how many cracked screens you see with the iphones. DURABILITY: I titled this in all caps because I want to emphasize how durable this thing is. I've not dropped it too many times and the screen is wrapped in a GLASS screen protector. However, the drops that have occurd have not scratched any part of the phone. The best part is that the water proof housing is legit. The only issue is water gets trapped in the headphone jack and must be blown out. You also cannot make phone calls under water... Read more|on September 7, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

217|Samsung Galaxy S5 has not disappointed me thus far. I purchased this in May 2015 and I have zero complaints. I am a previous owner of The Galaxy S4 which I loved but in terms of battery life it does not hold a candle to the S5 's battery life. In the beginning I was in love with my S4  but it began to lag and the battery started draining  so fast even on days with minimal usage.The S5's performance surpassed my expectations. I get 14 hours of battery time before charging is needed. The S4 did have a higher pixel density than the S5 but despite that, I prefer the S5 phone's screen much better. Its brighter, sharper and crisp. The charging speed of the S5 is impressive. I was amazed at how fast it charged up after being plugged in for 30 minutes. Another thing I noticed is the S5 design is more sturdy, rugged and durable which is what this busy mom needs. I dropped my S4 once and the screen cracked. I still love the S4 but the S5 is my new favorite.|on September 4, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

223|So as someone who was so stupid as to switch from the iPhone to this piece, I am only thankful that my roommate did have an iPhone when we needed to call 911 for a break-in scare. When I went to dial 911 you see my phone did not suddenly work. After some investigation I learned that I could not call anyone at ALL, and that this was because the phone had switched itself to disable all in or outgoing calls inside an elusive setting hidden inside a setting, setting called "Barred Calls". I never set up a pin to change this setting because who would have thought this secret (and bizarrely dangerous elusive setting inside a setting) could legally possibly exist. I have since had to speak with a T-mobile representative 3 times (after an initial 25 minute wait to get any help) and they have yet to figure out how to make my phone function. I am now waiting (for an estimated 35-48minutes) for yet another representative. After visiting numerous threads online I am appalled at how many have also experienced this problem and the only answer seems to be make multiple calls to try to find someone who can reset the elusive pin or take it into the store. I'm surprised no one has been reported dead yet because they were not able to make an emergency call due to this absurd setting. ESPECIALLY if you have a teenager and care for their safety, I would highly urge you to look at a different phone and avoid any models with the "Barred Calls" pin setting. It has no use when you can just block calls with one click. Truly unbelievable night tonight because of this phone.|on September 1, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

231|The phone came earlier than expected! Honesty, I don't know what else to say. I usually don't leave ratings or reviews, but this time it's worth it. Besides, the rating should speak for itself. GOMAB|on August 30, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
232|Condition was better than advertised but the phone will not update to current version of OS.  Will have to do some research as to why it's not on 5.0...I may just need to be hooked to a cpu and manually load.  Overall worth it for the price and condition.

235|great phone when it first came out, now with all the updates, the phone was very sluggish, and i say was because the phone is no longer working from water damage, fair WARNING to the potential buyers, the phone claims to be water resistant, dont believe the hype, keep the phone away from water, i sent mine in for lcd screen dying, and the was denied for water damage, i took the phone apart when they sent it back and none of the water indicators had been triggered, either behind the battery or hidden inside the phone, but there was severe corrosion on the lcd screen, in other words keep the phone away from water dosent take much and the phone will die.|on August 30, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars
236|I have the Samsung Galaxy S 5.  It SUCKS!!!! The phone turns on while in your pocket when you get texts, even when it's on lock.  This is annoying when you butt call and text random people in your contacts all day long.  There are 50 things wrong with this phone.  The last Samsung product I will ever own.  Many people I know are selling them for more reliable android/smartphone's. Do not buy this product|on August 29, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars
237|garbage garbage garbage. Ive been through 2 S5's in a year, currently using the second one both have been in an Otter box since day one.. they both constantly freeze, I hardly have/had any apps on them. text messages constantly lag! Worst phone I have ever had and I will NEVER buy this crap phone again. this is just as bad as HTC. I refuse to switch to Apple so looks like my next step is LG. Im very disappointed in Samsung! I hope Samsung has stepped up their game with the S6.|on August 28, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars
238|Even with a large SD memory card, this phone quickly ran out of memory, to the point where I can't even update my apps. I've installed far fewer apps than in my previous android phones, and moved every possible app to the card memory, and use the memory card for all my photos, music, and anything else I can. I still have plenty of room on my memory card, and I only use the internal memory when I have no other choice, such as certain critical or unmovable apps, and system functions But even with this minimal use of internal memory, it's full, to the point where my apps can't update, and the phone bugs me every single day to update the android software, but it can't since there's no room to do so. The reason is the phone is filled to the brim with useless bloatware, which you cannot uninstall. I tried to root the phone but it was too late, a small android update blocked that ability. So the phone is crippled to the point of being defective. It's a shame because the hardware is great- the camera and battery life are better than any phone I've ever had, the GPS works well, and the performance overall is great. Why they would ruin all that by putting so little memory in, and filling all of that with bloatware, is beyond me.. I bought this phone specifically because it was the last Galaxy that had a removeable battery and memory card, even though the S6 was already released, but it looks like I'll have to find another option soon, even though this phone is just a few months old..|on August 28, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

244|Used to love Samsung phones, now won't ever buy again. LAGS like nothing I've ever experienced. Lollipop is a joke. A major downgrade for this phone. It stacks the multitask screen in such a way that you accidentally close apps. GLITCHES like no other.  Just yesterday it spazzed out and reset my wallpapers. Other times it will close apps for no reason. Also, you can't use the pull-down menu after unplugging from charger, you need to lock it, unlock it, then pull-down. Lock screen sometimes unlocks itself in your pocket (even with a friggan passcode!) and will dial a random number in your contacts.... I've had this happen at least 10 times. CAMERA takes amazing pictures, when it works. 90% of the time it blurrs the photo (yes, I tried messing with various settings). Also, the camera will NOT focus on anything less than a foot away.... Charger is pretty clunky and obnoxious, very difficult to plug in phone without jiggling it a few hundred times. This phone would have gotten 4 stars if AT&T would allow a roll-back of the OS to KitKat. But they lock the phone. BE WARNED -ONCE YOU GO TO LOLLIPOP, YOU'RE STUCK WITH IT.  This phone could have been great.... I wrote this review after factory resetting it a few times, taking it to Samsung tech support, and owning it for 9 months.|on August 25, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

266|In it's hayday it was probably a good phone.  But Samsung fell off the Android wagon and onto the Apple wagon with their latest releases of the Samsung S6 and Note 5 -- no removable storage / no removable battery.  The S5 had some decent qualities but I have to ask myself for the extra $100 does it make sense to jump over to the LG G4.  Better camera, night and day difference screen, latest gen processor.  Only ding on the LG is the waterproof is lacking. I haven't been a big fan of LG in the past but I have decided to buy the LG G4 and pony up the extra $100 from the S5 to the G4.  Sure you hear some Samsung paid folks bad mouthing the LG's latest model but I am going to reward LG for doing the right thing versus trying to milk $200+ out of me in selling me 128GB of non-removable storage and giving me a non-removable battery headache.|on August 17, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

Good size, just no reason to go to the bigger 6+ inch phones. The Verizon service is great and buying it on Amazon I didn't have to go through the rebate hassles like I did with every other upgrade! Verizon could learn a few things about their pricing from Amazon. Great transaction.|on August 14, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars
275|It's hard to go from an iphone to the Galaxy S5, so I recommend you don't do it!  I picked Galaxy for slightly larger screen size, but I did not realize the daily hassles I now face, from needing to search for new messages and voicemails instead of being notified of them, to having to retrieve the phone from my pocket or backpack without touching the screen if I want to answer a call. And the spam-like "magazine" that pops up as you try to move between apps.  I hate it!I  I will switch back as soon as I can afford to buy another phone!

276|Up until just a few days ago, I have been a very loyal Samsung and AT&T Customer. Both my husband and I have Samsung phones, Samsung Tablets, and have been customers of AT&T forever. I was EVEN thinking about purchasing the Samsung Smart phone.  Not anymore. It is beyond comprehension to me at this time that NEITHER AT&T NOR SAMSUNG will apparently stand behind their products! Although BOTH AT&T AND SAMSUNG advertise that the Galaxy S5 Active devise is rated IP67 using the Ingress Protection rating system! As the Samsung user manual AND the AT&T commercials state: "The dust rating is 6 (highest level of protection), and the water resistance rating is 7 (WATER RESISTANT UP TO 1 METER for UP TO 30 MIN). Watch their commercials ...but don't be fooled. My phone was in contact with water for less than 3 seconds! ( It accidentally dropped in water and was retrieved almost instantly) LESS TIME THAN advertised: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4oan955C0A  The phone turned on for a few seconds...then went off....Then an hour later turned on with a green screen...then back off and was totally dead.  I sealed the phone in a dedicator for three days and it still would not come on. Samsung service said yes, it was under warranty and to send it in. IF they couldn't repair it , they would send an new one. Guess what!? They lied. I just received my original phone in what looks like worse damage than I sent it and I have been told that the mother board is fried..( NO DUH!) And that voids the warranty?  My mind is spinning. I really loved my Samsung Active, but I am sooo disappointed in the Service and the fact that Samsung would not replace it since it was less than a year old! I posted a complaint to Samsung's Mobile Facebook page and immediately got a response to private message them.  I got the same "canned" response there as well.  I may as well go bang my head on a wall. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE for the advertised Water Resistance.|on August 14, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

280|Here is the short version: in  the 5 weeks or so that I have had the S5, I have called ATT and Samsung at least a dozen times.  Among the issues: 1) apps disappear from the home page; 2) home and lock screen pictures disappear and have to be reset; 3) ring tones disappear and have to be reset; 4) contacts multiply; 5) turn on camera and hold the phone horizontally and the phone switches back to the home page; 6) the time changed on its own-- it is now an hour off.  We've reset the phone to original factory settings twice.  A replacement is on its way, but unfortunately I am outside of the 30 days that ATT gives for turning the phone in. Not to say that the phone doesn't have some nice features (like never having to deal with ITunes again), but do I ever regret not buying another IPhone.  .|on August 13, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars
281|I can't believe anyone who has this phone, likes it. It's a glorified hockey puck. It doesn't hAve any ability to hold a battery charge for more than a day, so to get it to work you have to turn off everything that you buy a smart phone for just do you can receive  and send calls. The port charger is flawed.  If you don't believe me just Google that. After 9 months they had to replace mone. I begged them to give me ANY other phone and they sent me another. Another year of agony.|on August 13, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

287|No complaints from me, not a one. I upgraded from an S3 and loved it so much that when it was time to buy a new phone, this was the first one I considered. We like it so much we bought four - one for me, my husband and our 17 and 16 year old sons.  We like that it's fast, has a gorgeous screen that is clear and crisp. I love that we can personalize everything, from icon look and names,  to any sounds you think of. Part of that is android, but Samsung wears android beautifully. If you want a smart, sleek, fast phone powerful phone that you can either plug-n-play ir personalize to your 💕 hearts content 💕, this is the phone for you. And the bonus of owning android phones? You can change the battery, customize EVERYTHING, not tied down to a certain store, tons of apps (and lots are free) and si much more. No regrets.|on August 11, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

296|I love this phone. Removable battery: I purchased 2 anker batteries and an external charger for $24.99 which perform perfectly. SD slot up to 128gig so do yourself a favor and get the 16gig version. Waterproof. Dustproof. Beautiful screen. Excellent camera. Slick and pretty UI. People complain about the matte finish but I think it looks acceptable not amazing but the tradeoff is no fingerprints and VERY scratch resistant (I have the white version)  The list goes on. I switched from iPhone and don't ever plan on going back. The only drawback is the messages lost in limbo from switching from iPhone due to the imessage glitch which is not the fault of Samsung or Google (THANKS APPLE) just another reason I won't be going back to iPhone anytime soon. Skip the S6 and go with the s5 as the s6 doesn't offer a removable battery and SD slot and is not dustproof/waterproof so the s5 is still superior in my opinion.|on August 7, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

307|This review is regarding my experience with purchasing this phone from Mango Wireless not for the galaxy S5 itself. I received this phone in a timely fashion; however, due to an extremely hectic schedule I was unable to get to switching over to it right away. Once I activated the phone it had consistent app crashes. After another couple weeks of trying a few things to resolve them, I contacted Mango Wireless tech support 1 day past the 30 day return policy. After working with their tech support for another month and a half to attempt to correct the issues, we were unsuccessful. The phone would not update to Lollipop over the air so they directed me to do it via samsung kies (which is basically not supported anymore by the way). I did this and tried to perform another update the phone kept prompting for, which in turn bricked the phone. At this point I was directed by tech support to xda developer forums to attempt to reflash the phone to factory. After multiple failed attempts, Mango finally agreed to take the phone back for a 30% restocking fee. So basically i paid $100 to troubleshoot a phone with their tech support (1 guy). This experience leads me to believe 1 of 2 situations occurred. 1. Mango does not actually test their "refurbished" phones prior to selling them. 2. Mango Wireless knowingly sold me a bad phone. I can say with the utmost confidence I will never purchase another product from Mango Wireless, and this was the worst experience I've ever had with buying on Amazon.|on August 5, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

321|After less than a month, the jury is still kind of out on this one. I've had Motorola Androids for the past few years, and this is a lot less intuitive. It required a lot more setting up and syncing than I recall my other smart phones needing, and I don't care for the trap-door cover where you plug in the charger. It suffered some sort of seizure episode the other night (again, less than a month) which seemed to resolve itself when I re-secured the little trap-door. That being said, it is nice looking, and I like the larger screen - the camera is much better than my old Motorolas. I generally adapt pretty well to new technology, so maybe I'll come to feel as comfortable with this as my former smart phones.|on August 2, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars
322|great phone, though un inspiring design. Maybe a little clunky? s3 was a lot more of a leap then the s5 is just more evolutionary.|on August 1, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars
323|Very happy with my new Galaxy S5. It arrived fast and meets all my expectations so far.|on August 1, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
324|I have had several Samsung Galaxy cellphones, the S 3 Mini, the S 4 and now the S5. The S5 is definitely the best one by far. Much faster to make a very important point. Also large clear screen is a big benefit too. It can be used just like a tablet and is easy to do anything on just like a tablet. Fits easily in my left pocket. Also stays charged a long time, because it goes to sleep when I'm not using it. There are oodles of options, I have not explored all of them yet. I would much recommend buying these phones from Amazon. I bought my phone from an Amazon Prime seller for $260. It was quite happy with it at such a bargain price.|on August 1, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

329|The guy at Verizon talked me out of this phone at first. I shortly came to my senses and switched to the s5. I love it. It runs every program I need it to and more. It has great visuals. The screen is the perfect size. Battery life is decent but not as good as I was hoping. Only change I would make would be camera resolution.|on July 30, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

331|I like everything about the 5 except the charge plug is a bit of a chalenge to plug in to phone, because of past experience i see it not lasting, because i usually keep a phone for over 2 years.|on July 30, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars
332|Switched from htc to a samsung... worst mistake ever. This phone is so glitchy, and it has so much lag. I've tried everything so fix it. SD cards don't work with mine either. It loses all of its data after about a month. Camera is also very slow and low quality unless in very high light.|on July 30, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

336|Pros: -The hardware itself is great. I get close to two days on a charge with moderate use. Cons: -This phone is filled to the brim with AT&T bloatware. Prepare to spend a few hours disabling/removing it. -Touchwiz is garbage and hasn't gotten any better. -The body of the phone is made with the same creaky plastic that Samsung has always used. You don't really notice it if you use a case.|on July 28, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

357|I had to write this review because I washed my Galaxy S5 in the washing machine-- full cycle-- then, when I realized it, removed the battery and let is dry in rice for a week. It still works perfectly. I was terrified when I discovered the phone at the bottom of the washer that it was done for, but when I saw the water damage indicator on the battery was still white I held on to a little hope. It seems this "water resistant" phone lives up to its name, and I for one am extremely glad I don't have to change to a new one for the time being.|on July 19, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

It is pretty durable, I have had mine for a year and dropped it pretty hard a few times and it is still working like a champ with no issues.

365|First off I want to say that this phone is not all bad. I only gave it two stars because it doesn't meet my personal expectations of a good smart phone. If you prioritize features in a different way you might love it. Here goes. The good: The screen is huge! Watching videos is awesome. It's pretty user friendly even to those who aren't totally tech savvy. Unlike the s3, this phone's setting screens are divided into categories making it easier to personalize your device. The camera takes amazing pictures, most of the time. I have a daughter and I love taking pictures of her so this was very important to me. The bad: Sometimes the camera wouldn't focus. I would have to shut down the camera and open it back up. Not too big of a deal unless you're trying to catch a moment really quick. I missed several photo opportunities because I had to restart the camera. It comes preloaded with so much garbage! There are over three pages of preloaded apps that aren't very exciting and you can't get rid of them so you start off with a slower phone. The charging port is awful! I have found this true of all Galaxies. After a couple of months you have to hold your cord a certain way for it to charge and eventually not even that works. And surprise, surprise one of the things not covered on the warranty or the insurance is? Yep, the charging port. Then you have to buy a new phone. Awesome. Overall it's not the worst phone I've ever had but I won't get another one (I've gone through 4 in the past year  a half) and I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. Maybe an enemy.|on July 13, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

373|A three might be too high a rating for this phone. I got mine in May of 2015. In June, the screen started to freeze until eventually it just locked up forever. The phone was still receiving calls, texts, and notifications, but I couldn't access any of them since the screen simply didn't respond to my touch. In addition to this little problem, there are several other things I disliked about this phone. It uses a proprietary charging cable, unlike any other I've ever seen. Of course, I bought several of this type before the phone died and before the salesman at the AT&T to whom I complained told me a regular micro USB cord would work. :-( The charging port has a cover that is awkward to open and nags you to close it when you remove the charging cord. The power button is placed strategically poorly across from the volume buttons so when you press one, you press the other. Software-wise, when the phone asks you which program you would like open this file with, you have the choice of two or three programs, just once or every time. If you choose every time, the phone basically says if you want this setting, go change your settings, which, of course, you never do because the moment is gone after that. The Home button is too flush with the phone to be easy to press. It takes more work than it should All of these annoyances are fixed in the Galaxy S6 which I bought to replace my S5. The only reason it gets 3 stars instead of 1 is because it's fast, sleek, and has a great screen. I was putting up with the annoyances because of that, so I'm kind of glad it quit on me. The S6 is worlds better.|on July 12, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars
374|Excellent smartphone. My last was a Galaxy Nexus.  One caveat, Don't turn off the lock screen.  If you do the phone will do all kinds of crazy things while in your pocket or purse or while being removed from there, the screen is that sensitive. Also, I highly recommend a PIN to unlock it, anything else can be hit while bouncing around in your pocket or purse.|on July 11, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
375|First CLASS Phone.  MANY features. Very good size, all around. Has nice hand feel and weight. The water resistance is a nice feature, too.|on July 11, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
376|The Samsung Galaxy S5 is amazing! It's durable, sleek, and it takes better photos than the iPhone any day. I would recommend getting a tempered glass cover for it, and a durable case, but other than that it's good to go right out of the box. The main reason I'd suggest getting this phone is for the photos. All phones make/receive calls, text, etc but this one is superior when it comes to image quality. I tried the LG G4 and was very disappointed when I compared the quality - so back to Samsung I went! I love that there are tons of accessories for the S5, because it's a popular phone. Buy them through Amazon and they're way less expensive than in-store! I got this phone on lease ($12 a month) with a contract through Sprint. I've had it for about 6 months now, and I love it. I think it's over-priced if you go through Spring, though, so I'd definitely recommend another carrier.|on July 11, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

379|I was afraid to purchase a phone from Amazon.  It turned out to be so easy and I saved a bunch of money.  The activation instructions needed an extra step, to log into your wifi first.  I was working on calling in to activate the phone.  While holding I logged into my wifi and the activation took off on it's own.  All my contacts and most of my apps transferred right over.  I had 1 app that is no longer offered and that my granddaughter loves.  Even that was on my new phone.|on July 10, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
380|This is our first "smart phone" and we are quite pleased with it.  It is easy to use and after taking a class we are enjoying all the perks over a regular phone; especially the camera.  It is better than our regular camera.|on July 10, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars
381|Best cell I've had. Durable with a fairly long lasting battery, and a fast processor. I don't regret buying the S5 even tho the 6 was available|on July 10, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
382|I upgraded from an S3 to S5 and that should be review enough.  What I noticed right away is how much smoother the operating system runs and how much longer the battery lasts.  I am a pretty heavy user, for example I like to use Waze every day to and from work and I only need to charge it once, at night, before I go to bed.  Big difference.|on July 10, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

391|I purchased a Galaxy S5 in February. As I'm sure you know the S5 is advertised as IP67 certified against water and dust. This Ingress Protection rating means the phone should handle any level of dust without being harmed, AND THE PHONE SHOULD NOT BE DAMAGED WHEN IMMERSED IN WATER UP TO 1 METER FOR LESS THAN ONE HALF HOUR. Earlier this week I waded to a boat with the phone in my pocket. Before doing so I made sure both the back cover and the charger cover were COMPLETELY sealed. The phone was no more than a foot under water at any time, and was under water for less than a minute. After finishing boating I waded back to shore with the phone in my pocket. Again, the phone was no more than a foot under water at any time, and was under water for less than a minute. Upon getting back on shore I checked my phone. Although the back cover and the charger cover were still COMPLETELY sealed, the screen would not turn on. I opened the back cover and saw water had gotten inside. The phone is now dead. I called Samsung's number, and the man I spoke with said that although the phone was still under warranty, the warranty does not cover water damage. Thus he said I could send it to a Samsung technician, but I would have to pay for it's repair. I then emailed Samsung. ESSENTIALLY THEY ADMITTED THE PHONE SHOULD HAVE HELD UP UNDER THE CONDITIONS I EXPOSED IT TO, BUT “ANY PHYSICAL OR LIQUID DAMAGE ON THE DEVICE WILL NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.” Since the phone was advertised as being able to handle the conditions I exposed it to, and I know other people have used their S5’s the same way and their phones held up, it’s obvious my phone was defective. But Samsung won’t stand by their product. Not only that a friend had the exact same thing happen to his S5, and Samsung had the same response. SO DON’T BUY A SAMSUNG, THE COMPANY IS SLEAZY, AND MAKES DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THEY WON’T REPLACE, OR FIX ON THEIR DIME.|on July 8, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

393|Ok, I never write a review on my phones, so I have to be really impressed to write a review! I went to a marina to watch some fireworks on the 4th. While sitting on the side of a boat, I heard a plunk, and realized my phone was in the water. My fault, so I can't get too upset. It was dark out, so no one was able to see it. I thanked my lucky stars for the cloud saving my stuff, and went about my night. About an hour and a half later, my friend's son said he could see my phone, and points to the water. MY SCREEN WAS LIT UP! (Mind you, I also lost the plug on the bottom of the phone the week before!) We rigged a kids tadpole net to a long pole, and fished my phone out. IT WORKED! I took it apart, dried it out overnight, and it is almost perfect ( the back button doesn't work). Unbelievable! Everyone I was with has an IPhone, and I'm pretty sure they are getting a Samsung after that accidental display. If you are a klutz, like me, this is the phone for you! If you just want a super dependable phone, get this one. I am still in disbelief!|on July 8, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
394|This phone was advertised as used but like new in box. This is absolutely true. I've had my phone for a couple months now and it was absolutely new looking in box. I would purchase from this user again. I've had zero problems with this phone. It did not come with a sim card, but the Sprint store will give you one for free if you need one.|on July 8, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
395|It's a lovely phone, with clear screen graphics. My only complaint is that the charging input isnt a common cord and it is hard to insert into the phone. I'm very dexterous and it is hard for me. This is a bad sign.I think greed got to samsung on this choice. HAving to use their charging cord only is being the burr in my back.|on July 8, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

397|Excellent phone! This was also bought with the Life proof Fre Series case you can check that review over there. Lets get started, this phone has wonderful features to it and its a very long lasting one, Lollipop with it is amazing as well and this phone runs fast and smooth and has a very beautiful 1920x1080 screen resolution. Pros: • Very fast, tasks can be done easily and quickly. • Beautiful design to it and it keeps its looks after a few hard years. • Samsung just keeps coming back hard too, it's still a really good phone if you can't afford a Galaxy S6 or the other phones that are pricey. Cons: • Has some jet lag here and there but it gets it out of its system real quick.|on July 7, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
398|I've had this phone for just over a month now after being away from the smart phone scene for a couple of years. I'll admit I was attracted to the phone for the price at the time, $1, and ,my fiance has the galaxy notebook so I was already familiar with some features and how samsung worked. It has been great. The only downside I can think of (which in the grand scheme of thing really is not that bad or anything) is that the charger is not the same as my fiance's notebook, so we really can't forget any chargers when we go on trips and it didn't come with the lightening fast charger. The battery life has been really good considering how much I use the phone. The size is perfect for me. Still loving the phone.|on July 7, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

417|This is my most regretted purchase. I am nothing but disappointed with the phone. It's incredibly overpriced for the low, low quality Samsung continues to deliver. If you care to hear why I think this read on! Worst phone I have ever owned. I upgraded from the S2 which had it's fair share of problems but I wasn't prepared for how many problems the S5 had. I'll make a list and add to it as I remember problems because there are far too many to list all at once. Notifications: text notifications will not go away for 10-30 seconds after reading the new message. Voice mail notifications sometimes wont show up for several days after you receive a voicemail. Texting / swype word recognition: Word recognition is abysmal. Texting someone "What's up?" is a chore with this phone. The S5 on average gets about 50% of the words I'm trying to type correct. Some common changes it forces are: What to Ehartt, Something to Simmering, and MANY more. Most of the time it corrects the intended word to a word that I don't even believe exists. Or it will change it to a word that you never have and never will use. Touch pad recognition: somehow there is an inherent lag or delay associated with Samsung's software and the touch pad response time. This probably contributes to the very poor word recognition when texting stated above. Sometimes you'll be using the touch screen and it wont even recognize your touches. Other times, it will recognize a very light touch as a swipe and call someone unintentionally. I have never drunk called anyone until I got this phone. I pulled it out at the bar once to reply to a text from my girlfriend and in the motion of simply putting the phone back into my pocket it decided to call her. I wasn't even that drunk. She woke up to a 20 minute voice mail of my phone in my pocket. Camera: GARBAGE. Do not believe any of the hype or specs. A powerful camera is useless if it is unable to take a clear picture without contorting your body and standing still for 10 seconds while it tries to focus. This is the absolute most difficult camera I have ever used. I was surprised how powerful this camera looked on paper at least. As soon as I tried the camera for myself I was a bit confused. a large majority of the pictures come out blurry! Unless you have direct sunlight or a professional photography studio it is very difficult to get the camera to focus. More often than not I find myself standing in uncomfortable positions staring at the phone screen while it tells me to stay still while it tries to focus. Sometimes this can take upwards of 10 seconds just to focus. And then you will most likely have to repeat the process about 10 times in order to get the picture clarity you deserve with this very expensive "smart" phone. I've had multiple people ask me to use a different camera to take detailed photos of the items I'm selling because of this. I feel like a disposable camera would be better sometimes. I just spent 5 minutes trying to get the camera to focus on large text on a fast food bag, it could not even do that. I ended up spilling half of my food while contorting my body to try and get the camera to focus. I am very, very unhappy with this camera. Speaker is pathetic. You can easily mute your phone unintentionally just by holding it a certain way or laying it on a bed or other surface that would cover the speaker. I've slept through multiple alarms on full volume and I am a light sleeper. Listening to any music on the phone is not recommended, there is no bass and if it tries to produce any the phone rattles the plastic case. Plastic case: Get used to this rattling. When I have the phone in my pocket I can hear the case rattle and creak with every single step I take. Just now I was changing the SD card and a plastic clip on the back plate of the phone broke off. Fingerprint scanner: Doesn't work 2/3 times. Remember your password! I tried it for a month or two before I got sick of entering my password and just changed the screen lock to a password. Battery Life: I have no real complaints here. It lasts about a day with minimal use before needing a charge. Very comparable to other smart phones that I've heard about or owned. Bottom Line: Don't buy this phone. It sucks.|on July 2, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

427|The time came to upgrade my last phone, the HTC ONE so per some of friend's reviews I decided to go with the Samsung over the new HTC ONE M8. What I love: I love the lightweightness (I made that up) of the Galaxy. It's easy to hold on to and is sleek in it's design. Some complain about the battery cover but I'm a fan! I really enjoy the removable battery, sims card and memory card. One major disappointment I had with the HTC ONE. Now, getting to the inside of the phone. At first I wasn't thrilled about the magazine, news feed on the home screen but if you don't like it, there is an option to turn it off. The personalization on this phone are great for my needs! Another great point is the motion controls! Let's say your phone is ringing and you want to shut it up without touching it. Well, Samsung made it so that you can turn on an option to turn your phone over to make the noise stop. My favorite feature on the phone is the camera! I LOVE THE SAMSUNG CAMERA!! Samsung really hit it on the nail with this one. One of the major reasons I chose this phone! From the selective focus option, HDR, different modes, and most of all the Samsung editing studio. Fire up your video and you'll have pre-loaded customizable themes you can use with music and lots of filters! I love it. Now what I don't like so much. I don't have many things that I don't like. The main issue I have is the LAGGING time when viewing pictures in the gallery. Samsung really lacks in this manner. One thing I didn't have to deal with my HTC ONE. If there is a picture of video that you need to access quickly, I'd advise using the the "tag or keyword" options so that the photo can just be searched. Otherwise , you will be frustrated by the slow populating pictures. The other annoying feature of the galaxy s5 is the sensitive finger swipe option. First off, you must swipe your finger "exactly the same way" to register the finger and then comes the "fun" part. Swiping the finger to unlock the phone is sometimes a chore! It either tells you that you have to swipe all the way down, all the way on the keypad, swipe faster, swipe slower, etc. If you have patience, it's a great feature. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Maybe next time I'll even try another samsung phone. One last tip: one of the first things you should do is to make sure your phone isn't set to factory reset if you accidentally forget you pin, password or pattern. If you don't disable this option, too many incorrect attempts will factory reset your phone and erase EVERYTHING!|on July 1, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars
428|My first smart phone, yes I'm way behind the times.  A love / hate relationship at first but getting the hang of it.. battery lasts me well over 24 hrs (I'm not a heavy user though).. Had no problem with the upgrade to Lolliopop 5.0 even though alot of owners have posted about bad problems after downloading it.. perhaps the newest phones now come preloaded with it.. I bought this phone in June 2015 and downloaded the update before loading any apps.  On the advise of Samsung support I did a factory reset first (had nothing on the phone to lose so made it easy)..I think alot of folks have trouble with conflicts with older apps when switching to Lollipop, safer to do it with nothing on the phone when it is new.. I'd rcommend this phone, beautiful screen clarity and brightness.|on July 1, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

431|Wow... I upgraded from the S4 to this expecting little to no difference (the 4 was starting to frits). Some of the subtleties like the waterproof housing blow my mind. Anyone reading this has already done their research on the features. I am here to tell you that it is a tough phone too! No hardware or software issues yet and I'm approaching the one year mark. Buy with confidence!|on July 1, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

The camera is amazing, the touchscreen and display are large and fantastic.  I really liked the fact that I can add memory and replace the battery, all while being water resistant.  I am by no means an expert in the world of telephone technology, but this phone seems like a great little computer!  The quality of this product is another reason a lot of the electronics around my home are Samsung.  I recommend to anyone wanting a droid smartphone.|on July 1, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

440|I found a great deal on my gold Samsung Galaxy S5 on Amazon. I had been using a Straight Talk 3G smart phone for several years and decided that it was time to upgrade. I love the expandable memory on the S5, which I understand the S6 does not have. I am still not ready to put everything on a cloud, so the micro SD card is still my preference. I am happy with the Verizon service, even though the Straight Talk phone used Verizon lines. There is just no comparison in the improved service of the post pay 4G Verizon plan. My new S5 works mostly off my Wi-Fi, so I was able to get a very affordable plan by only paying for the data I will use. So far the minimal data is way more than I use and is affordable. The camera on the S5 is phenomenal! Once again, I found the best  deal on Amazon. Just a note of caution: I did have some minor trouble getting my old number transferred and the young Verizon salesman was really not wiling to help because he did not sell me the phone. It worked out well though, because the Amazon staff WAS able to resolve the problem. The little technical glitch was WELL worth the money I saved, and probably would not even have occurred if I had not been trying to transfer the number from Straight Talk which does NOT have the best technical support.|on June 29, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

443|I got this on Verizon upgrade for $. 01! My husband got the Note 3, 5.7 screen, (he loves it, all-in-one device prefect for him) and I was considering it for the big screen but was concerned about carrying it with the kids. The s5 has a 5.1 screen and fits my small hand better and still has a big screen for me to read, browse, play games, etc! It came with Android 4.4 and I set up a Samsung account and they upgraded it to 5.0! (They did the Note 3 too!) If you want a big screen and a smaller phone go with s5! If you need more all-in-one phablet and don't have a problem with big, go Note 3! We love both!|on June 29, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

469|BIG PROBLEM: You are forced (yes, absolutely forced, as in, not given ANY choice) to update your phone to Lollipop. More on that below. Nothing is perfect, but I was compelled to write this review because of the inane Samsung / Verizon / Google policies and marketing. I may update the review later, but you can find a LOT more on this issue on the internet. 1) The phone was nearly PERFECT balance of power, size and capability with Android Kitkat, 4.4 2) The phone really SUCKS in many ways with Android 5.0 Lollipop ( lollipops are terrible, cheap candies that are really really bad for you, while kitkats are nice chocolates, is that a coincidence?). Battery life, looks, you name it, it is just not that good. I manage two of these phones. The one with Kitkat (the only way to keep Kitkat is to root your phone) functions perfectly, love it. The one that got the Lollipoop disaster is horrible. 3) FORCING the update on customers; Now, that is what really gets me. Imagine, if was MICROSOFT FORCING you to "upgrade" Windows 7 to 8.. Well, in essence, that is what Samsung / Verizon / Google have done. They all point fingers at EACH OTHER, but mainly the blame lies with SAMSUNG, I think, and, secondly, Verizon, for not standing up to Samsung for their customers. Google gets slapped for making a crappy OS change in the first place.  I had a Samsung rep PERSONALLY admit to me that there is NOTHING they can do, and one has to just accept the fact that they force the operating system update on you. Unbelievable! If I choose to update, I accept the risk, that is understood. But, OS update should ALWAYS be end user choice!  When I asked them to pass my complaint to their marketing department, the rep told me they were prohibited (!) by company policy to talk to other departments!  Enough said. In conclusion: To keep Kitkat you will have to root this phone. I never felt the need until now, but I was not going to be forced into the Lollidowngrade. I am so glad I did. I have no problems at all. I would NOT buy this phone with Lollipop. I would rather go to Apple, and I nearly did. Apple does NOT force you to upgrade the operating system, by the way. Policies like these make no sense. I have been Android fan since it came out, and had just about every version of Android device ever made, but the direction this is taking is likely to drive me, a loyal customer, away. The three-headed hydra may not care, but Apple just might get another customer next time I buy a phone.|on June 22, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

The shipping was fast, set up was easy, and they didn't change anything with my Verizon plan that I did not ask them to. The phone was as described (New in original Verizon box). I would definitely order another phone through Amazon, they have the best phone deals.|on June 22, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

473|It's a decent phone for Android, but trying to go a step up from the s4,  it's incredibly disappointing. The s4 is much better than the s5. It's like the intuitive guys who made the s4 got fired, and some retards from Apple made this phone. All the nice little features from the s4 got ruined on the s5. You can no longer have any widgets or shortcuts on the lock screen, the only thing you can have is a camera shortcut. You can't clear your ram, you can only close all the open apps,  and it still doesn't really clear the ram, whereas the s4 cleared the ram but kept the apps you were using open. The timeout on the lock screen is too short to do anything but briefly look at the time. Don't try to look at any of your notifications because the screen will lock before you even get a chance to look at them. It's just a bunch of really annoying stuff like that. It's unintuitive,  which doesn't make any sense seeing as the s4 was intuitive and they somehow went backwards. I mean if you're going from an iPhone to Android,  it's still pretty good,  but after having an s4, I regret buying this, and just want my s4 back.|on June 21, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

481|Yesterday I was extremely surprised with the resilience if the S5. Someone in my life got mad, and tried to at best bend my phone in half, and at wrist break it in half. He is very strong, and bent it backwards for several seconds. This was after it had been thrown down the hallway and hit the door frame hard enough to leave marks on the case. The screen did not crack or even come apart from the phone. The back cover is still a tight fit. The phone is fully functional! The only visible evidence of the trauma my phone suffered is that it does not lay completely flat anymore. Pretty darn good for what it went through!!

This phone was good on 4.4.4 (Kit Kat), but not anymore. I have not received any updates that would address this slowness, but nothing. The battery is horrible.

Both my wife and kids have I-phones and I continuously hear them complain about various issues they have with their I-phones.  (My wife has an upgrade coming and she is getting the S5.)  For that reason alone, I did some research and chose the S5.  What separates the S5 from Apple is the fact that you can replace the battery and add a storage card.|on June 15, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

The girl that replaced this fancy junk pile said "there's a 99.5% chance it will happen with the replacement as well" so this phone is going back in it's box so it can't play mind games with me.

Amazon did provide us with Samsung contact information, Samsung did accept the phone fpr warranty repairs and now the phone is working fine again.  Buyers need to be aware of how warranty policies are handled for any/all purchases.  All's well that ends well!|on June 10, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

518|I switched to Verizon from another company. I had an S5 on both. This one doesn't have Contacts crashing all the time nor an issue with being unable to get the screen to come back after pressing the power button. Not to mention Verizon is cheaper month to month and has great service and reliability where I am. I'm happy with them and this phone|on June 9, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
519|I love this phone! Great size, great price, perfect weight. It runs all the games I want it to. Has plenty of room internally for my photos and videos. I also have a SD Card. It is nice to have the option to expand the memory.|on June 9, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
520|Unable to block anonymous,  private and unknown numbers when a number is blocked out. Preferred my SG3. Honestly abhors the Facebook notifications. Preferred seeing them not in a box. Main reason for 2 star rating. Unable to block calls that don't have a number attached. Me shouldn't need an additional app to block. My SG3 had that feature.|on June 8, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

533|This is my first smartphone and it is great.  The only thing I do not like about it is the size.  My last phone (a flip phone) fit nicely into my pocket.  This is huge compared to that.  It was fairly easy to set up and has all the features that I need.|on June 5, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
534|I've heard a lot of complaining because people didn't like that the back of the phone was plastic, who cares? one of the main reason people love these phones is because they like being able to remove the battery and add extra storage but what they don't understand is that if the back was glass or aluminum then you wouldn't be able to do that! so stop complaining and thank Samsung for making a few of the only phones that you can work on yourself. anyways, this was my first galaxy phone, and I couldn't be happier. my only regret is that I didn't switch sooner. plus the blue color is so pretty and really stands out.|on June 5, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

I am not a big fan of bulky cases, i HAVE dropped my phone a few times, my toddler uses it and it is still in perfect condition, in my opinion it is durable and withstands the punishment of everyday life!

546|Phone works great, and all functions work as they should.  The only exception to that statement is the Web surfing.  This phone is only slightly faster than the phone I had 4 years ago, and significantly slower than my Droid razr M.  This problem is primarily on wifi, which I use the majority of the time.  This doesn't ruin the phone experience for me, but prevents a 5 star rating.|on June 3, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

551|I have had my phone for six months and I’ve had four phones in my lifetime. By far, this my best phone because it takes nice pictures, it doesn’t break when I drop it, and it’s also waterproof. I like the product because it takes good pictures, it doesn’t break when I drop it, and it charges fast. Its battery lasts a long time. It’s also water proof so when I drop it in the sink or in a puddle, it doesn’t break. Also, I can text with non-texting gloves in the snow because the keys are not too sensitive. One time I was walking to my friend’s house and the phone fell out of my hand. I was scared that it cracked because I couldn’t get a new phone if broke. I felt relieved that it didn’t break.|on June 3, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars
552|It's hard to find anything to complain about when you pay a penny for a phone. This phone would have probably made me happier if I had not allowed the Lollipop upgrade. It is buggy and apps and accessories don't always work with this "upgrade" so I really don't feel like this phone is a great improvement over the S3.  But, as mentioned, I really thing this is due to the operating system.|on June 2, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars
553|ok|on June 2, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars
554|The going rate to upgrade a phone with a particular company these days is outrageous! This was a great investment compared to what it would have cost me by going through my carrier and I didn't have to sign a contract either! The phone was delivered to me in just a couple of days. I was able to find easy apps to transfer all of my information from my S3 easily in the Google play store.|on June 2, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

557|Honestly. How can Samsung fall on it's face so badly? I love the features, but this phone is slower, less interesting, and a step back from the S3!! I am unimpressed. The charger cover breaks. It DOES leak- I spilled a tiny bit of coffee on it and it got in despite it being completely closed. It has been buggy and glitch since I got it. I am so highly disappointed with this product. I have had THREE now, with all similar problems. I should go to apple!|on June 1, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

563|Here is my profile as a verizon customer: I've had a cell phone since they came out, or at least when they became convenient and feasible...late 90's maybe? I have never been with another carrier other than verizon. Upgraded to a smartphone when the first motorola droid came out. Never once late on a payment, never missed a payment, never turned phone off, re-upped after every contract expiration. Here is how they treat this kind of customer (me): I was out of the country on vacation for 3 weeks in January. I called verizon to see about using my phone abroad. I was told I had to purchase an Intl data plan and pay the charges for Intl minutes and texts. Okay, fine with that. I explain to the rep that I only need this for one month while traveling, and that I want it off my bill once I get back. I'm told they understand. Service is intermittent and less than ideal while abroad. I get back, verizon continues to charge me $25 extra a month for the next 4 months, for the Intl data plan. I let 4 months go buy without inspecting my bill carefully, which I agree is embarrassing. Anyway, I call to dispute the extra charges and they tell me it was my responsibility to call them back to stop the service upgrade, meaning Itnl data plan. This was not communicated to me when I activated it, I tell them. So I'm told by the rep that verzion will comp half of the extra charges, not the whole amount. That's not good enough and I should not have to accept that. Clearly I didn't used the Intl data plan the last 4 months. They have record of my usage. I stated initially that I only wanted that service for 1 month while traveling. I'm not even asking for anything above and beyond, I just don't want to pay for something I didn't use. Well. verizon's position is that they will take advantage of these kinds of occurrences by referring to them as customer errors, which isn't an error as I mentioned above. They do not take into account customer loyalty or legitimate grievances. Comping half the charges is an insult. "Here, we'll just take half your money." Which I why I'm going elsewhere once this last contract is done. And why I type this. And why I will communicate these facts to everyone I know.|on May 30, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars
564|Exactly as stated. Like brand new. Only maybe two tiny lil marks on the back side, which is nothing. It's been working like a gem and I couldn't be happier. These people are who they say they are and sell what they promise.|on May 30, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
565|Great phone and super price|on May 30, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
566|When I purchased this phone off Amazon it was the first time I signed into a contract with Verizon. I was nervous about purchasing this phone off Amazon initially because I didn't know which smart phones were good but based off the ratings I read, I went ahead and purchased this phone. I was very satisfied with the price I paid. It came to $1.07 with a two year contract. The phone exceeded my expectations. I love the camera and the ability to edit my photos. And you will see that the camera is something a lot of people on here were quite happy with. I also like the fact that it has a removable battery. I hate phones where you are not able to remove the battery. It gives me a peace of mind that if something were to happen with the battery I am able to get a new one versus having to replace my phone. Immediately after I purchased this phone I seen the Note 4 and was a little upset that I did not get that phone but after my boyfriend purchased it I would have to say I'm happy with my decision on getting the Samsung galaxy s5. Although it would be nicer if it had the size that comes with the Note 4, there really isn't any feature the Note 4 has that makes me regret my decision with the Samsung s5.|on May 30, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

577|Love this phone. Perfect size|on May 29, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
578|From a purely functional point of view, the phone is basically flawless. Although I'm more familiar with apple products, I found the Android/Phone functions easy enough to to get used to after a day or two of fiddling around. However, after a week of ownership, I find the phone to just be too big for my liking. And no, I don't have small hands. I'm 6-3 with proportionally-sized hands. One handed operation is a chore. The phone does include a mode to make one-handed ops easier by making the screen field smaller.........of course, this negates the purpose of the larger phone. In the end I should have gone with a slightly smaller phone. However the phone DOES work as advertised, has good battery life (even with updated lolipop os),  water resistance, Sd card, beautiful display, and several other nice features. So spending two years with this phone shouldn't be too hard.|on May 28, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

584|So this phone *was* great. I have always preferred Android OS to iOS, and I have grown to really like Samsung's line of phones (bloatware notwithstanding) I have had this phone for exactly 1 week. 7 days after I bought it, I went to sit down. The phone was in a side pocket, all by itself. I did not sit down with abnormal force, or even with the phone side down, but yet the phone's screen completely cracked. Yes, the phone was in a case, no, I had not dropped the phone previously, to possibly damage it and make it ripe for a crack. So yeah, I highly recommend staying away from this phone, unless you like looking through cracks.|on May 27, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

587|My husband is in love with his phone. That said, I have to say, I am a tad jealous as I have the S4. It is not a huge upgrade from the s4, but from my husbands s2, it is a HUGE upgrade. Size, weight, and even what it can do. He is not a techie kind of guy, so he has not really gotten into that part of his phone. I do know that by the tone of his grunts, he is one happy man playing games on his phone. As I learn more about his phone, I will expound on my review.|on May 26, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

590|Great phone, although it frequently feels like I'm holding a cereal box to my head if I'm taking calls. It also allows me to use my fingernails to do stuff with the screen, which I've never been able to get an iPhone to do. Battery is great, one charge goes maybe 3 days. The graphics and camera, which are the real selling points for me, also fantastic. I like the backup button on the side of the home button, as well as the instant task manager button. At the time I got this, it was at the top of the market and I overall have no real complaints about it.|on May 25, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

603|PROS: Great flagship phone. Love that it has expandable memory and a removable battery. Customization options are endless. CONS: The battery life dies on my pretty quickly sometimes, whether I'm actively using my phone or not. A good fix for that is to turn off the LTE, and only having it work via CDMA.  While that saved a lot of my battery, I still feel like it could be better. The response time is also a bit slow. Sometimes I'll tap an app or want to switch screens, and it takes a while.|on May 22, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars
604|I purchased one of these directly from the Verizon store last fall and was relatively satisfied with it, but a recent upgrade to the Lolipop operating system has cut the battery life in half, now it won't even make it half a day without running down the battery, and that is without power draining apps like WiFi or Hotspot turned on, it is in pretty much just standard standby mode with few phone or now phone calls, yuck.  I am very disappointed with this phone at the moment.|on May 21, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

609|Samsung should be very ashamed for the defective S5 The fingerprint reader works just well enough to make you think it might.  The voice dial is a sick joke.  Sometimes I initiate from a Bluetooth 4.0 headset only to have a voice answer out of the phone still on my belt.  Samsung should fire some engineers.  The fingerprint reader might actually get them sued. I have to admit that I am truly astounded by the incompetence of Verizon Wireless customer service.  I spent some amount of time on the phone and was told that I could keep my existing plan, trade in any smart phone and just pay $100 (maybe plus another $40) to get a Galaxy S6.  I was told that I could go to a Best Buy mobile in a neighboring city and pickup the S6 phone.  The rep assured me that she was updating the notes on my account for the Best Buy representative.  Before driving over 30 miles I called and spoke to the Best Buy manager.  After looking up my account he informed me that they do not have access to the notes on my account and went on to explain that the representative had given me total misinformation and any upgrade would cause me to lose my grandfathered plan.  But wait, there's more!!! So then I call and ask to speak to a manager and the rep insists that I explain everything to her why I want a manager and finally puts me on hold where I waited until disconnected.  Then I called back in and the representative told me that managers did not speak directly with customers so I shared with him that I would then spend my time posting reviews about VerizonWireless. I have never encountered a company like VerizonWireless where EVERY TIME you call you will get a completely different story.  I hardly think my words will do anything to lower VerizonWireless's reputation on the web since it seems there is no lower place for it to go but just felt to try anyway. Verizon Wireless had me contact them privately on Facebook to resolve the issue which turned out to be an insulting waste of my time when all they did was say their standard blurb.  You cannot believe a word that any customer service rep says on the phone.  Verizon Wireless will NOT honor any promises made by their representatives.|on May 21, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

611|The GS5 is faster than my old GS3 (as expected with a newer generation product).  It is a bit bigger, which I didn't like too much, but am getting used to.  I liked the size of the GS3 because it fit in my pocket better.  The GS5 takes up a lot more space in my pocket so there isn't much room for anything else (i.e. a hand).  The fingerprint scanner on the button on the bottom face of the phone is a nice feature, but I found that it doesn't work so well when your fingers are sweaty (doing yard work) so I have had to input the backup password sometimes, which slows things down when you are trying to skip a song or access your phone while taking a break.  In the U.S. this phone comes with a funky USB 3.0 cable.  At first I thought that I would need to buy all new chargers for my car and travel, but I found out that you can still use the micro USB connector to charge and transfer content to your computer.  The Micro USB connector just connects to one side of the new connection on the phone.  The new connector cable allows for faster transfers to your computer...it doesn't charge faster.|on May 21, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

624|Beware of the lollipop. I use S4 as a work phone issued by my employer. Until the new lollipop os came out, I tolerated it's quirks. Now that the new os rolled out, I can confirm that our entire department of over 200 employees all hate how it looks and works. The new color scheme is hard to read and may only please a handful of teeny bobber technocrats that have young eyes and love to perform thumbnastics on the phone. As for professional use, this new change has guaranteed that I and many of my co-workers will never get one for personal use. This video illustrates the new "upgrades", but as you will see, also shows how the readability has degraded. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QETNpd57kk|on May 15, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

629|Worst phone ever. I switched from an iPhone 4S to this piece of crap. It is constantly telling me I am out of space (when I have a 64GB SD card) and I have to delete 2-3 apps to install a new one. The phone is slow and freezes all the time. Even after restarting it daily. I will never buy a Samsung again. It's back to iPhone I go!|on May 15, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars
630|I am so upset about this phone. I bought it online for a penny. I thought it was so inexpensive due to the fact that the Samsung 6 was coming out. My screen without having dropped it became discolored and had lines across it. I had this phone for less than 1 month and It was placed in an otterbox immediately. Now sprint will give me a new phone which is refurbished however this phone had to be refurbished to have broken so quickly.|on May 15, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

642|This phone has been a disaster for me. I am an entertainer and run a small business off my phone. On one trip the GPS started sending me gibberish, with contradictory instructions. Then it completely lost the signal. As a result, I was late for my gig. I have NEVER had that happen with any other phone. Of note is that the same thing happened to the person with me on that trip, who also has the S5. In addition to that, my phone won't let people leave messages for me. Instead, it asks callers if they would like to listen to messages.|on May 11, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

Don't like that it updates and installs apps without my permission. I changed from iPhone to Droid so I'm also still figuring things out. I don't know what the deal is with the Google search popping up when I hit the home button but it's incredibly annoying. I take the battery out mostly for that. It stops it for a week then it's back again.|on May 10, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

650|Love this phone. I will say though, coming from a Droid Maxx there was a noticable difference in call quality. I read reviews before buying and I was nervous and the reviews are correct. The call quality is a bit choppy and hard to hear at times. However still an overall amazing phone. I've owned iPhone and Android and I prefer android.

658|Phone is excellent. Very durable has already hit the pavement a few times and no cracked screen or scratches. Battery life is quite good lasts a lot longer than my other phones. Phone is slim and has a beautiful display. Easy to customize!|on May 7, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
659|The phone has some great features - big vivid screen, great camera for outside landscape shots and only good to acceptable in medium to low light or high light indoor conditions. When you look up a contact or phone number by a person's name, even if you type the entire name in it will bring up lots of other related contacts and you have to scroll to find the exact match. VERY FRUSTRATING. The new lollipop upgrade is unhelpful and requires a lot of changes to get the original easy volume, mute and vibrate settings. You have to go to Android Central to figure it out because the phone changes the settings you used previously. You will lose some functionality. The battery runs down fast because the phone doesn't close apps you are not longer using. You have to remember to close all frequently to save battery life. Its a good phone and I'm glad I got it but wish it wasn't so complicated to use.|on May 7, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

There isnt even a crack in the screen. everything looks perfectly fine except the screen wont come on at all. This is the SECOND GS5 ive dropped that this has happened to and now IM DONE with samsung. I was all in with samsung because they partnered up with google, but now i realize they simply make CHEAP POORLY CRAFTED overpriced PRODUCTS. Guess now im selling all my samsung products and trying to recoup some of my loses from the many failed phones, chromebooks and other failed samsung devices and im going crawling, reluctantly.

669|Very easy to use, and since I use Gmail/Google all of my contacts and Apps were brought over to the new phone.  The only thing I needed to do afterward was put in the login info for some Apps.  The camera is excellent and love the zoom in/out by pinching the screen or you can set it up to use the volume buttons.  It has a much nicer feel than my old Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, but the battery doesn't last as long as the Droid.  Only down side that I can see.|on May 6, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
670|Switched from an LG G2. I've had several Android phones in the past, and I decided it was time to try the "best". I'm a little disappointed. My G2 just felt more responsive and could handle more tasks running in the background without getting overly hot, which this phone tends to do. It does have a cool-down feature that kicks in automatically, but it leaves me wondering how the G2 didn't seem to need it. The fingerprint scanner is pretty cool when you can get it to work properly. I find myself having to swipe my thumb more than once, almost every time. The battery life seems to be shorter, plus the storage is only half that of my old phone. The camera is better (back not front) and it has an impressive speaker for calls and music. It's a decent enough phone, I just wish I had upgraded to an LG G3 instead. Oh well...|on May 6, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

672|I was strongly comparing a handful of phones, I honestly didn’t know which one would best fit my needs. There are many different screen sizes, screen pixel resolutions, and operating systems that make choosing a phone a bit difficult. Luckily I found that site justafax (justafax.com/phone) that compares all the phones I was interested in side-by-side. For example, I was very surprised to find out that the Galaxy s6 comes with android 5.0.2 – not all phones come with the latest android, so you have to be careful when you purchase! Also in terms of pixel density this is one of the better phones on the market, according to Justafax.com/phones it has more dense pixels than the iphone6. Overall I’d say if you know what you want, then this could be a great phone for you, but it’s worth comparing all the phones side-by-side first to get a good understanding of what each have to offer.|on May 6, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

678|For some reason every phone I have owned by Samsung since the early days Samsung Glyde, I have had problems.  I bought this phone less than a year ago on an upgrade from Verizon because I needed a phone and thought that is a great phone.  I was wrong although Samsung did improve on their system and gave this phone a fighting chance I had a couple of problems.  First the positive The phone is gorgeous and huge, plus stays charged for days  Negatives it's a Samsung you will notice me say this and say what? why is that a negative?  go out and test different phones   My favorite phones in listing from most to least love it.  LG Env (Verizon) <----Brick awesome basic phone indestructible  HTC SV One (Boost Mobile) <---- must have for Boost Mobile Blackberry Curve 3350 (Verizon) <------ Currently using this it's a PDA and my fave phone to impress people business phone HTC One MAX (Verizon) <------ picked this for my dad he ran it over with his wheelchair countless times  HTC Desire 510 (Virgin Mobile) <----- cheap phone works well  Samsung Galaxy S3 (Boost Mobile) <------- My mom and Aunt both had one and there are charging problems and also performance issues Samsung Galaxy S5 (Verizon) <------ Fun up until 6 Months then started slowing down and new update makes it slow|on May 5, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

681|Pretty darn great phone but not yet 5 stars compared to an iPhone. The hardware is probably a bit better than the software. Too much bloat and it is hard to get just the apps you want without chewing through huge amounts of (expensive) data. Really needs a app that watches all other apps that want to upload or download via cell signal and explicitly ask you if you want to burn through "X" amout of data to send or receive any given item(s).|on May 4, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

684|This was a purchase for my wife.  She uses an IPhone provided by her work.  I had an S4 to compare and she liked the Samsung much better.  The S5 has been very reliable for her and she likes it very much.|on May 4, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
685|After upgrading from the Galaxy S3, I'm finding the S5 to be a disappointment, mainly due to the software.  Verizon appears to continue to push a ton of BLOATware to their new customers - dozens of apps you don't need and you don't want, that crap up your phone and do not reliably inter-operate with Google apps.  If you don't switch to their apps, you're constantly hounded.  And their apps are inferior to others out there.  There's no simple way to migrate from the S3 without losing a bunch of apps and data that don't transfer for some reason - so it took me a whole day to try and get my new phone loaded with some of the data and apps that were on my old phone - the last transition wasn't nearly as painful.  I'm still seeing all kinds of problems with things like custom notifications?  Forget about it.. while you can add custom ringtones off the SD card, you can't do this with SMS notifications - this is incredibly annoying.  You can try copying files to certain directories but maybe they'll work for a little bit, and then the new custom notifications disappear and are no longer available - makes no sense.  The hardware appears to be top notch, but the software for this new iteration SUCKS.  I'm about to switch from Verizon I'm so tired of having to waste my time cleaning out their crappy, buggy software.|on May 3, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

688|I had a Galaxy S3 that I loved. The Galaxy S5 had some changes I did not like. Chief among them was the clarity of others being able to hear me speak. This is because it is water proof, so the phone has to be held perfectly for it to pick up my voice. I multi task, but am unable to do so while on my cell phone. I have to have one hand free to hold the phone just right. I do not like using Blue Tooth, so that is not an option.|on May 3, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars
689|Excellent smartphone!|on May 3, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
690|The S5 is a good smartphone with a wealth of features, but the security is poorly designed from a functional standpoint. Many people want to use a PIN, password, or screen pattern to protect their data. The S5 has all these options, but you can't use them effectively if you use Bluetooth headsets or car connections because the S5 will not allow the Bluetooth device to access the phone until you manually unlock it. This defeats the purpose of hands free.|on May 2, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

I purchased the Anker batteries for it and just swap between batteries. I've had no issues with compatibility and the Anker batteries actually last longer than the original Samsung battery. The screen resolution is great. The fact that you can swap batteries and add micro SD cards are a big plus.

720|I've been wanting a Samsung 5s for awhile now, but could not upgrade my plan due to losing my unlimited data. When I bought this phone I was a little hesitant because I've never bought a phone on amazon before. I have to say I am extremely impressed. I absolutely love this phone. Taking pictures are so clear. texting Bluetooth everything on this phone is just very impressive. Going from a note 2 to a Samsung 5s is a huge leap and I am so glad I did it. The gentlemen who I bought the phone from was a real sweetheart as well by including a little note and his number in case I had any problems. I thought that was big of  him. Love my phone.|on April 28, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

734|A word of caution for Galaxy phone users: BACK UP YOUR PHOTOS. Back up anything you want to save to your computer....not just your SD card. If you're already doing this, good on you. If you're not, start today. This is my 2nd Galaxy phone, and the 2nd Galaxy phone to die. 1st one, Galaxy S2, dumped my SD card information, then a week later died. I replaced it with this S5 and things were great, until it wiped out my SD card 4 months ago. This morning I woke up to a dead phone. I tried all the usual things, pressing this, holding that, new battery, blah blah blah.....it's dead. I pulled out my SD card and there is nothing on it. It F'n formatted my card before it died!! You have been warned.|on April 26, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

743|Upgraded from Galaxy S3 and love this S5! Takes a little getting used to but it's great, volume is louder when watching YouTube videos, great camera with better low light photos, much better quality front facing pics...I have liked this line of phones better than any of my old phones.  Have had the HTC Evo 3D, it was good, so was IPhone, but the camera, free apps and interface makes these phones great!|on April 24, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
744|I upgraded from the Galaxy S3 and I am very pleased with this phone, the more I mess around with it the more I like it. Apps like S Health are now more focused than ever and the heart rate sensor is great thing even though tech reviewers try to play it off as a gimmick - this phone has literally made me want to be more active since I purchased it, the biometric scanner is a great addition as well that works perfectly for me 8/10 times. Also great news is that upon typing this I found out that micro usb chargers still work with this phone (it's a USB 3.0 port that can also use a micro usb). No BS Apple move. The feel of the phone is the best of the series. Yes it's plastic but it is definitely more upscale feeling to the touch while maintaining a light weight, and aesthetically both the front and back look great. The screen is the best I've ever seen on a smartphone, crisp, colorful, and bright. The camera is an important feature for me and I'm happy to say it doesn't disappoint - it's fast, takes great photos, the live HDR mode is awesome as well. The only thing i'm not sold on is the 16:9 aspect ratio being the only mode at 16mp. You can do a standard 4:3 aspect but at 12mp. But still not necessarily bad since mega pixels don't mean much compared to the actual sensor used. The speaker is loud and clear, reception for both the phone and wifi is great too. Better than my S3 with the 4.3 update, on that note Kit Kat is awesome! One last note, the IP67 rating/ water resistance and dust resistance is an amazing and welcome feature. In Conclusion, If you're coming from an S3 then your contract is probably up this year, and this is an amazing upgrade to a phone I loved. It really wasn't even a question for me. Size, aesthetics, features, adding your own memory, and still being able to replace your own battery made this a clear choice over the HTC M8, and others.|on April 24, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

750|Im missing my galaxy siii compared to this phobe. The front face camera is low quality, the phone stopped charging after 3 months, and phone keeps freezing or randomly shut down on apps. I called samsung to fix this issues under warranty which they were very willing to do, but i would have to mail in the phone and potentially be without a phone for around 2 weeks. They don't send loaners or have any options locally for those who only have one phone. I ended up buying a external charger where i have to switch the batteries twice a day (it dies so quickly).

766|Great phone at an impossibly low price (.01 cent).  Had a few glitches with email, but working very well now.  Was considering an iPhone 6, but the Samsung price (on Amazon) ultimately sold me. It replaced a Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, which was having issues with email, GPS, and other basic services that caused extreme frustration.  One of those problems was cutting off incoming calls as I tried to answer (it did this frequently).  Apps would start downloading without asking just when I tried to make or take a call, and that would interfere with calling and other tasks.  (most of the problems did clear up after a factory reset, but then they started to return, which is when I went to the new phone). The new Samsung is not as sleek as the older Motorola, but it's attractive enough, and I was able to get it in white.  what I don't like:  the power plug is non-standard and requires opening a little cover on the phone (I think this is what helps it resist water), and I'll have to buy an accessory if I want wireless charging (don't know if the Motorola allowed wireless charging).  The apps are also a little different.  I miss Motorola's tiny email preview app (Samsung's takes up a whole page) and its tiny calendar preview app (Samsung's app uses 1/4 page, horizontally); the apps on the Motorola both fit easily on Motorola's front page with room to spare.  Samsung, by contrast, uses a full half page for the front page app that shows time, date, weather, etc, leaving room only for 4 small app icons plus 4 core app icons.  Was excited to have fingerprint unlock capability--until it didn't recognize my fingerprint after umpteen swipes.  And I miss being able to mute the phone with a simple swipe while unlocked; the Samsung, by contrast, requires me to turn on the phone, unlock it and push the volume button down.  But those issues are mere annoyance compared to having a very good phone that works without problems (so far) at an insanely cheap price. And I do like that the Samsung has an exchangeable battery and easy to get at external storage (motorola's external storage compartment was so hard to open I didn't even try until I had to to remove the SIM and storage cards before recycling the phone).  Camera works great.  sister says the sound is much better on the new phone.  All in all, I'm very happy with the new phone.|on April 20, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

774|The phone has worked perfectly for 6 months. Issues with the Android OS. Last week Android/Google automatically added several apps that cannot be removed as an upgrade without asking first. This is annoying. They upgraded the whole Android operating system to Lollipop and some features changed that I preferred under the previous version. I had to set new backgrounds, color schemes, settings and other minor issues that were time consuming to deal with to return the phone as close to previous settings as I could. There are likely more issues I don't know about. They reset fonts; so small a magnifying glass would not have helped - the font settings had to be reset. Why not install a new OS that maintains prior settings? Even Microsoft does that. I am not a fan of Google, but am also not a fan of the iPhone. So overall, I love the Samsung phone but the Android/Google OS eaves a little to be desired. In its favor, Android has a far superior selection of apps.|on April 19, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
775|It's hard to call this phone trash when it's capable of doing so many more things than the average smartphone. The problem is, half of these things sadly either don't work well, or don't even work at all. One of the more noticeable flaws of the phone, is the fingerprint scanner. Why is this flawed? Because half of the time, it doesn't even work. How is this even remotely convenient when it takes me a full 5 minutes just to unlock my screen? And the directions on how it works don't help very much either. Another major gripe that I have with this phone is the pathetic touchscreen. I've never had a phone lag so badly to the point where after turning it on I couldn't even unlock it. And it does this on a regular daily bases too. This didn't become a problem for me until about 2-3 months after I got the phone. This must be why all the reviews on youtube talk so highly of it, because they review the phone after the first day or week that they've had it while the phone is still at least somewhat fully functional. The camera is probably one of the most embarrassing things about this phone. While it may not be bad hardware-wise, software-wise it's atrocious. The fact that a camera from the 1980's can take better pictures than this thing is pretty laughable. The auto-focus (if you can even call it that) rarely even focuses on the thing your trying to take a picture of, so every time you take a picture of something, it looks like your wearing the wrong prescription glasses. How a phone with a Quad-Core processor is ironically 2x slower than my old phone that had a Dual-Core is completely beyond me. And don't even get me started on the so-called multi-window feature. Why even bother to make a feature that only lets you use about 10 of the apps that nobody ever uses? I will say this though, the things that do actually work well on this phone (almost) make up for the things that don't. The waterproof capabilities (at least so far) do work pretty well and it saves me from the trouble of having to throw away $80 on a life-proof case that isn't even shock absorbent. After one little drop of water lands on the screen, the phone is nearly impossible to use (until you dry it off again). I'm surprised that this phone has as many flaws as it does after hearing so many people say so many good things about Samsung products. Regardless of it's flaws, the phone does have a lot of potential, and with a few more sufficient updates that offer major improvements, could be something great. Other than that, I am on the fence about buying another Samsung product in the future.|on April 19, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars
776|Purchased  this phone to replace my older one and was very pleased with how quick I received it and the additional information sent confirming the purchase and what to do to activate it.

781|I just moved over from Sprint, and I'm blown away by the customer service both from Amazon wireless and Verizon! But I suppose I should talk about the phone first... I previously had a S4 mini, so I feel like I have a tablet up to my ear now! LOL! I'm joking, but it is a major size difference. This phone is no shrinking violet. Within a couple days it upgraded to Lollipop, and I'm impressed with the changes. I'm not sure how much is the phone and how much is the change in the network, as I've gone from Sprint to Verizon. Everything operates quickly, the network has service where ever I go thus far and I'll be testing it more this coming week when I go out of town on vacation. When I purchased the phone, I called Amazon and they were very polite and answered every question I had about the phone and service. I've also had to make several calls to Verizon because I ported my number from Sprint and had a few issues. After spending the better part of a decade as a Sprint wireless customer, and getting crappy service, I never thought people would work so hard to make things right. Verizon has awesome customer service! Both companies have been fabulous about this making this change, and I couldn't be happier!!|on April 16, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

788|I used to have a Galaxy S3, so this was a big step up for me. I've had this phone for a while now, so here's what I've learned. PROS: * Display is clean and clear. Colors look great, blacks are deep. Screen size is comfortably large but not pants-bulgingly huge. No complaints there. * Handset size is good. Fits my hands well, but probably a bit big for most people to use one-handed. * The IR port is an unexpected great addition. You don't know freedom until you never need to find a TV remote again. * The USB port cover not only helps keep it "water resistant", but helps keep pocket lint and stuff out of the port that eventually cakes up and causes charging issues. * Speaking of the USB port, this thing charges faster than any phone I've ever had. I'm a big fan of the (included) two-part USB cable. * Call quality is generally pretty good, but of course that depends on what kind of service quality you have. CONS: * Finger scanner is poor. It often takes 4-5 swipes to detect, and works terribly if a) plugged in or b) you have a case on the phone. * Heart rate sensor is just a gimmick. * Comes packed with all sorts of junkware apps and stuff from Samsung and Sprint. * Camera is okay. It performs well in bright daylight, but is atrociously pixelated in moderate to low light.|on April 15, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

794|While it says two day shipping, the phone wasn't shipped until my account was processed, so you might end up waiting a day or two extra before it ships. I was patient, and I'm glad. It's one hell of a deal getting such an amazing phone for just a penny under a new contract. I've been using the iPhone since the very first one. I swore I would never touch another phone brand other than Apple. But as time went by, the more phones they released, the less impressed I became. It was basically the same phone being released every year with a few tweaks to the UI and some nice, but mostly trivial additions. The Galaxy S5 has me feeling the same way I did when I got my first smartphone. The way multitasking with multiple apps is handled is superb. I was getting sick of switch between apps in the iOS when I needed to get stuff done. Overall, if you're interested in the Galaxy phones, I'd say the S5 is a great way to start. The Galaxy S6, while visually appealing, turned me off with their glass back cover and lack of SD card slot/removable battery. Either way, I'm now a happy Samsung customer and fan.|on April 14, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

As for the design complaints, I look around all day and see 80% of phones have cases, so the plastic construction only matters for the first two days of ownership before you get a case like everyone else. Also I purchased this phone for $80 and its priced fell to $1 five days later. Called amazon and they refunded the difference in a flash. Very happy!|on April 12, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
813|I have never had as much trouble with any other phone I have had in the past as I have had with this phone. I've had multiple iterations of iPhones as well as a Nexus 5. This S5 cannot hold a candle to any of those phones. These past few months have been nothing but trouble with this phone. The battery would be completely drained not four hours after being fully charged. I would get text messages days after they were sent to me or often times not at all. I would have constant issues with the storage on the phone. I was told that I couldn't even update my applications, that there wasn't enough room. I knew for a fact that there was plenty of space on the hardware as well as on my memory card. I have contacted Samsung multiple times about these issues and none of their suggestions have worked for me. They advised me to send the phone to them so they could physically troubleshoot it. That is unacceptable. What am I supposed to do for a phone while they tinker with it and later charge me? I have given up hope on Samsung and have already order my new phone, the Motorola Nexus 6. I rolled the dice on a brand I had never bought from and I suffered for it.|on April 12, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

822|Went from an iPhone 4s to the Galaxy s5 after recommendations from friends. After I purchased it, I found out my friends did not have the s5, but earlier models of the Galaxy. The s5 does not live up to the hype. They brag of extended battery life; however, I charge mine at least twice a day (with minimal use). It runs hot. Apps lock up. And don't get me started on the lollipop update. I've had this phone a year and I guarantee when my contract renews and I can get a discount on another phone, this one is getting tossed.|on April 10, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

835|I'm not an Apple user but if I had to do it again, I'd buy an iPhone.  Do not buy this phone unless you want to spend half your time in the Sprint repair store OR opening the back and pulling out the battery several times a day to reset.  This is a new phone.....which was supposed to be a replacement for the same phone which also didn't work....but for different reasons.  I've had Sprint check the phone -- they say it's fine -- but every day...several times a day...the phone freezes, is unresponsive, stops and restarts on it's own.  VERY frustrating.  I've read all of the Android forums AND the Sprint support articles and have done all the things they say to do to fix the issues.  NOTHING WORKS...at least for me. They must know something's up b/c there's an entire Sprint KB article on what to do if your phone freezes, starts/stops...etc.  Great display....bad operating system.  I have upgraded to the new Lollipop OS but it made no difference.  Get an iPhone....|on April 8, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

843|This phone is utter garbage. It's saving grace is simply the expandible memory slot and replaceable battery. The Google Now feature is so glitchy I have to restart the phone multiple times a day regardless of a quick tap or if I hold the button down. Also, my keys...not heavy but metal tapped the screen (that apparently has gorilla glu in it) and cracked it immediately into spider webs. Per Samsung support I have to pay $250 to replace the screen. Ridiculous and terrible product. I will be going back to an iphone, both options suck in my mind but I gave the S5 Galaxy a whirl and I absolutely, positively despise the quality of the phone and the software as well. If you want to jump on this bandwagon do so at your own risk. I have a screen protector and case and the thing barely lasted 2 months with a light key literally by itself tapping the screen and cracking it. Gorilla glu...yeah right. What a joke.|on April 7, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

850|Fabulous phone! I supplemented its 16gb of memory with a 32gb sim card. Available memory (my biggest gripe with my old phone) feels unlimited. Brilliant display, lightening fast. Love the increased size of the phone. Almost a mini tablet but not too big to comfortably carry in your pocket. Purchased the Otterbox Defender case and am very pleased with it. The heath app has permanently replaced my Fitbit (which had become unreliable after only a year). My only (minor) criticism is the fussy cover over the charger port. It takes my big fingers a few tries to open it. The best tech purchase I've made in years.|on April 6, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

855|This phone is a great phone if Amazon doesn't send you a defective one. When I recieved the phone, the Camera was off, but I did not have anyone to compare the camera quality with. Finally after 6 months later 2 friends also purchased the phone from the Verizon store and I compared how the Camera was. My images color was off, blurry, and lighting was not correct. Within the first 1 month, I noticed a hairline scratch one the screen which this screen was supposed to be scratch resistant. About 3 months later the Chrome bezel started to chip off by itself!

I got used to the large screen and there are some cool features but I am mostly disappointed because I dropped this guy once and the screen cracked only a few weeks after I got it, my old iphone 4 had been dropped numerous times but never got one crack.

879|I'm in an interesting position for this review. I have a work phone that is iOS (iPhone 5 if that matterrs) and this phone as my personal phone.  Having used both for over a year I can now give a pretty accurate assessment.  The short version is that this phone sucks.  It's slow, somewhat buggy.  Extremely prone to turning on when it's in your pocket.  Very prone to sending calls to voicemail when I get it out of my pocket.  Overall I'd give it one star.  It's just a chore to use.  Of the 3 or 4 Android phones I've used, I'd most comparre this to the Samsung Moment (another bomb in my book, seems like a trend).|on March 31, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

883|I am a long-time Samsung fan, having had three phones over the years. Typically I have no desire to replace my Samsung phone after two years when I'm eligible for an upgrade, because even though technology advances a lot in two years, I am happy with my phone and what it can do. I was very happy with my Galaxy S3, but it was damaged and I decided to replace it. I went to Verizon and with my upgrade I could get a Galaxy S4 for $50, or pay $199 for an S5. What? Then I remembered about Amazon, and saw a great price on the S5 and the ability to upgrade through Verizon with Amazon, which is NO DIFFERENT than doing it on the Verizon Wireless upgrade site. You log in to Verizon through Amazon and process your upgrade, except you pay a lot less with Amazon for this particular phone. More people ought to know about this, since many people I talk to don't realize that you can get any phone you want - you don't have to go through Verizon Wireless to upgrade your phone. We have options, people! :-) I knew the S6 was coming out soon, but I never need the "latest and greatest" model and I knew I'd be happy with the S5, and I am. I didn't realize how many tiny little annoying things were associated with my S3 until I got the S5, then all of the sudden it has features and conveniences that practically changed my life, if you can believe it. I don't like to exaggerate but this phone truly thinks like I do, and anything I wanted to modify or customize, I found I could do it easily with this phone. It is very, very intuitive and endlessly customizable. I updated the OS for the new Lollipop not long after getting the phone, and though there are a few things that I didn't like about that upgrade it did not lessen my love for this phone. I don't want to rattle off all of my favorite features, because everyone has their own set of features that are important, but I could not be more pleased. One thing I was worried about was that it would be a whole lot bigger than the S3. I have very small hands and wondered if I'd be stretching out my thumb too far to try to hold it in one hand, but it did not prove to be a problem at all. With both phones out of their cases the S5 is only slightly larger, and I don't appreciate much difference in my day to day life. Maybe the S6 is just light years ahead of this phone, but I doubt it. I don't usually give reviews for my phones because so many people have the same model, and everyone is accustomed to what to expect from a smartphone. I thought I was too until I got this one and was delighted with some of the shortcuts and improvements that were made since the S3 that makes life just a tiny bit easier.|on March 31, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

888|Buying a Galaxy S5 was a HUGE MISTAKE. Save your money.  I had such a bad experience with this phone and Samsung Customer Service, I'm making it my life's mission to tell you all about it.  I would rant about how its promised "ultra power saving mode" is a load of crap (my battery barely lasts 8 hours), but let's focus on Samsung's empty promise of water resistance and craptacular technical support First, I purchased my Galaxy S5 December 2015.  I loved it's promises of resistance to "sweat, rain, liquids, sand and dust, so your phone is protected for any activity and situation."  These situations obviously do not cover spilling tea on your lap, or, perhaps, tea is not included in their list of approved "liquids." That's all it took.  A cup of scalding hot tea spilled in my lap whilst I had my Galaxy S5 in my back pocket.  After leaping around the house and stripping myself of my lava-soaked clothing, I wiped the phone off, confident of its ability to stem the tide of my steaming Earl Grey. Oh what a fool was I.  My phone started acting a bit fritzy and wouldn't charge.  I took the phone in to Best Buy and the Samsung rep took the back cover off and found moisture under the battery.  Turns out my charging port stopped working. WHAT THE HELL?!?!  I let it dry in some rice, but nothing worked.  Damage was done. I had read that faulty charging ports are a thing, so I contact Samsung to see if they could fix it. I contacted Samsung and the online chat service was polite and concise.  The rep asked me to mail my phone in (oh yeah, the shipping and packaging cost $15) and they said Samsung would evaluate it.  I tracked my phone on Samsung's convenient tracking system, and they had my phone ONE DAY.  ONE FREAKING DAY.  I thought, "Wow!  They are quick.  They replaced my charging port and shipped it out the next day."  HORSE S***! They returned my phone and the documents said "Water Damage. Corrosion.  Your phone is unable to be repaired." Now, if I want a replacement I have to file an insurance claim and pay, get this, a $200 deductible. Buyer beware.  This phone promises water resistance, and the company promises customer service, but my broken phone determines that is a lie. Stick with your iPhone if you are considering a change.  I had one for two years, and while I'd break a screen every 8 months, at least the phone still works.|on March 30, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars
889|This phone was advertised as a Verizon Wireless S5, but upon taking it to a Verizon store they said it was the AT&T version. This will not be able to work on my plan and now I am back to square one.|on March 30, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars
890|Great phone, looks brand new. Only delta is that it does not come with a SIM card. You will have to go to a Sprint store that has SIM cards to get one (Note: some of the Sprint stores do not carry SIM cards so call and ask before you go). The SIM card is free if you already are a Sprint customer. Great deal on the phone overall, and it's lightening fast with the Android Lollipop OS update.|on March 30, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
891|it's so bad i won't use it. it is literally the most poorly designed, user-hostile piece of fecal matter that's ever been "designed". the word "designed" is in quotes to show how little i think of the process of its creation. it's worse than the M-16. it's worse than ANYTHING. I DO NOT have time to "just play with it." I DO NOT have time to read the entire manual. When you buy a truck, there's a little picture of the hood opening, located on the hood latch so you can open it. NOT SO on the Galaxy 5! NO, you're just supposed to KNOW that you have to swipe the corner of the screen... NO HELP for users. If ONLY I could give negative stars...again, this is the most poorly-"designed" piece of equipment that has ever been foisted on an unsuspecting public. oh, by the way, I have been using computers since 1980 and I an able to write my own programs in 5 different languages...|on March 30, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

I bought this phone just before leaving for trip to Las Vegas.  I had minimal time to test it and figure out the uses I bought it for. It worked perfectly from Vegas and by the end of my 5 day trip there.... I was able to work all the functions and beyond what I may use regularly.   Would recommend this phone to others.

906|Has a few quirks but then they all have their own ways. Price was fabulous. One Dollar !!! and it was shipped quickly. No one at Verizon could believe the price. They wanted $199.00 with a $49 rebate. Why would anyone buy a phone from a dealer? Get the tempered glass screen protector it helps protect the screen from breaking as well as scratching and it's also extremely easy to install. It costs from $4 to $8 at Amazon or E-bay. $25 at Verizon and the 2 year Square Trade Warranty was $99 and you only pay a $99 deductible. Verizon charges $11 a month (that's $264 for 2 years) and their deductible is $149.|on March 27, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
907|pros: excellent battery life, front camera is amazing gives a great wide angle. I have dropped beer on it and it still works great so its definitely waterproof! The size of the phone is perfect hand held size. Best thing about Samsung is they let you remove the back cover to exchange the battery! I no longer have to charge my phone i bought a couple of extra batteries to carry so i can change them out whenever my battery is low! cons: If you phone does not come with the Lollipop android update DO NOT UPDATE IT it will suck the life out of your phone, the battery will die instantly! Ive had this phone for 3 months and sometimes when i try to use the speaker phone option it doesn't always work or when i try to watch a video online i sometimes don't get sound so i have to restart my phone!|on March 27, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

909|This is the best phone I have ever owned. I have upgraded to Lollipop 5.0 with absolutely no problems whatsoever. I use this phone 12 hours per day, and still have plenty of battery life to run another 12 hours if needed. I cannot say enough about the greatness of this Galaxy S5. I purchased this phone for $0.1 (1 cent) on an Amazon web special with a 2 year contract, and free shipping with my Prime membership. Deals like this are rare, so I jumped at the opportunity. I even called Verizon about this special, and they told me it must be a typo. Thankfully it wasn't, and the phone works great. Thanks Amazon.|on March 26, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
910|This phone failed in less than a month. Amazon replaced this phone with a new one when i made the call to customer service (as I was in a family emergency at the time). Amazon's customer service is the best on the planet, and 2nd to none. The rep was very understanding, and gave 1000% of effort to help me. The new phone arrived very quickly, and has worked well since. The key here is NOT to upgrade to Android 5.0 Lollipop until all of the bugs are fixed by Samsung and Google. However, I will say this; I own the copper colored S5 and I did upgrade to Lollipop 5.0 as soon asd it became available. My phone works flawlessly, and the battery drainage problems that everyone talks about, doesn't exist on my phone. On a full charge with heavy usage all day long for 12 hours, I still have 75% at days end. It doesn't get any better than that. No SD card problems, No WI-Fi problems, No Bluetooth issues or performance issues. I run Bluetooth all day, and I run "Space HD" Live Wallpaper. I keep power saver set to "On" and turn vibrations, keyboard and phone touch sounds "Off".|on March 26, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

921|Love the phone.  I really wanted the Note4, but I couldn't pass up the fantastic price for the S5. It basically does everything that the Note does, albeit in a smaller package.  The screen resolution is fantastic and with the Ultra Power Saver mode when the battery is low, I don't have to rush to find a charger.  All in all I love the phone.|on March 24, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
922|Fast, powerful, takes great photos. This is easily the best phone I've ever owned, I absolutely love it. I had been torn between this and the Note4, but am really happy with this for much less money. The screen is plenty big, it fits in a pocket and my purse, it fits my smaller hands, and if I wanted to I could get a stylus and set up Evernote to do handwriting recognition (which was what I really wanted the Note for). Voila, mini Note. Very happy with this purchase.|on March 24, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

928|Before I had this phone I had an iPhone 5. I was and still am absolutely fed up with Apple and it's ways (way too restrictive IMO.) I knew I was going with android for my next device and per the reviews the GS5 was the best one available. It's got great graphics and I like the size a lot. I love the fact that it's water resistant, it helps me breathe easier when I'm using it around water. A few cons now. The battery life is not good, I have fairly good charging habits, I wait until the battery is close to dead before I charge it again. But it's not that simple anymore. After one day at school with my phone on ultra power saving mode for most of the time, I come home around 3:30 with the battery at 40%. The battery is way too small for the size and power of the phone, so I recommend getting an extra battery with an external charger so you can just swap batteries whenever you need. The battery life is so frustrating that I have to give this 3 stars. If I could go back I'd still get this phone because I don't like the LG G3's button placement and I dislike the Nexus's lack of an SD card slot. It's a good phone, but I would highly recommend  an extra battery|on March 23, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars
929|So in love with this phone! I purchased the copper gold version, and as soon as I saw it out of the box, I knew I'd made the right decision. It's a really unique color, I usually see people with the slate or white variations. The phone arrived really quickly, and I love that I only had to pay $100 to upgrade to this (I had an iPhone 4S previously). I really missed the Swype option that I was used to before trying out Apple, so it's nice to have that again. Only complaints I have are that there is a LOT of bloatware on the s5, with no foreseeable way to delete it off your phone. But it keeps trying to update itself even though I've disabled it. And disabling certain pre-installed apps can interfere with the phone's ability to work properly. Also, I can't really adjust the home and lock screens without a lot of the picture getting cut out, and autocorrect overshoots the mark often. So that's kind of obnoxious. Other than that, really happy with the s5. Glad I made the switch back to an Android. The camera takes beautiful photos, and has a lot of neat little built in photo editing bells and whistles. Wouldn't trade it for anything else.|on March 23, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
930|Much better than S3 !!|on March 23, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
931|Owned and used for about 6 months now. I like the fingerprint scan option but it can be a bit fickle from time to time. You have to scan ur finger in a precise way. But once u get used to it it's not bad and I unlock my phone many times a day. I only rarely use the password option. BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT. I get a full day of mixed use(checking Clash of Clans, FB, news apps, texts and the occasional call) and usually have at least 20% battery life left at the end of the day. Sometimes a lot more. My day starts around 6 am and ends when I get home around 9:30 pm. I have used the extended low power battery option only once. It works as advertised.  However I only used it for 1 extra day in the ultra battery saver mode. If u only use ur phone lightly u might be able to go 2 full days or more on regular mode without rechargeing. I switched over from a Motorola Bionic. The S5 is faster has better battery life by far. Also take good pictures. Also it is quicker to acquire my GPS location for navigation. My only complaint is that occasionally, the Facebook app will show a zoomed in view of pictures that folks post. This requires me selecting the actual post and looking at the full size view to see the whole thing. It is odd and I think it is a FB issuance and not a phone issue. It has since been corrected by the latest FB app update. But still happens occasionally when browsing the FB app. So far I love the phone. I no longer worry about having to charge it every day or twice a day like my last phone.|on March 23, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

937|This item was delivered as stated in 2 days and the activation process was really easy.  Basically, turn it on and follow the instructions.  Really easy.  In addition, if you are a current subscriber to the cell phone network, you will have the option to keep your current service plan if it meets the service required for the new instrument. I was very pleased with the whole process of getting the phone from Amazon and it saved me $100 by using this option to upgrade my phone.|on March 21, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
938|I love my Phone but I will never purchase another phone thru Amazon. I am as my kids and friends call me The Amazon Queen, I have never been more disappointed with Amazon than when I ordered myself and my daughter's new phones. When ordering you are asked 3 questions, 1. Is this a new plan? 2. Are you on a family plan? 3. DO you just want to upgrade the device? Well I chose to only upgrade being that I have been with AT &T for numerous years and I already had the plan that I wanted to keep. Well once the phones got here and we had them activated I started receiving text messages that we were running out of data. How could that be and we have 30gigs? Well needless to say Amazon decided since I didn't pick a plan when ordering it would give me one, the lowest they had. There are 3 adults on my line, 300mb is not even enough for 1 person. So mind you my bill & plan are now jacked up. A bill that is Usually $220 came out to be $430 after this mishap. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!|on March 21, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

957|A little disappointed, since freezes up quit a bit|on March 17, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars
958|My wants are simple. I want a phone that I can make calls on (calls that I don't lose), send and receive texts from, look up info online, download the occasional handy app and sometimes use it for mapping directions. That's basically it. However, I have been disappointed with the last few phones I owned (Droid Razr Maxx). After a few months, they were SLOW to do anything and often froze up on me. This phone has been the best smart phone I have ever owned! It does exactly what I need it to, when I need it to. I charge it every other night and never have to worry about a dead battery. When my husband and I are debating who that actor is in the show we're watching (I'm always right!), I can always trust my phone to be fast and efficient when I look it up to prove him wrong. :) When we're out driving around and it becomes obvious he's lost, I can quickly get the info I need from Google Maps. Really, I have absolutely no complaints about this phone and would recommend it to everyone! I've had the phone for 8 months now and still loving it. I do want to mention that I did have one problem with it, but it was more about user error. I'll share the info in case it helps someone else at some point. I have one of those step tracker bands that I wear on my wrist (Jawbone UP24). It has an app on the phone and it connects with the phone to send it info. A few months after I got my phone (and my band), the battery started dying suddenly and quickly and it wouldn't connect to the internet. I was so disappointed thinking it was just like the last phone I had but then finally discovered why it was doing that. I quit wearing the tracker band, but the app was still on my phone and it was "searching" for the band all the time. Once I started using the band again, all went back to normal. When I quit using this band again (which I will, but that's an entirely different review), I will definitely make sure to uninstall the app as well.|on March 17, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

965|Extremely disappointing. I have had problems from day 1 with this phone. first, the camera has not worked right ever since it came out of the box. Second the constant crashing and bloatware, half the data is already used on this so the 16gb is pretty much false advertising. Not even 6 months of having the phone the charging port broke off, Never been abused. it's been in an otterbox since day one. And now the charging port broke in 11 months!

If you like the big screen-like phones, Get it!  I would give it 5 stars then.  This was my first try for this size and just too much.  Get it right from Amazon.

It was extremely slow and the home button did not work about 75% of the time.  I know It is supposed to be a great phone, so I was disappointed to get such a dud.  Amazon processed my return quickly, but it has been in their hands for a week already and they have not reversed my contract so that I can be eligible for an upgrade again to get another phone.

993|I've been using the S5 now for 3 months, and at first, I thought that even though it wasn't all that different from my S3, it still was an upgrade. I whole-heartedly disagree with that thought now. The S5 gets hot and loses battery life rapidly even though I'm not running any background apps.  I have to charge it twice a day. On my S3, apps would open immediately, whereas on the S5 there is a noticeable delay especially for the camera or maps. Android is still a great OS, and the screen and camera quality are good. Samsung needs an update to fix the overheating and battery issues.|on March 10, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

998|The whole experience of purchasing on Amazon was great! The activation instructions were thorough and relatively easy to follow. My only advice would be to make sure you've backed up everything to your wireless carrier's cloud Before your phone arrives. For Samsung users, especially those of the S series, the S5 has all the upgrades you'd want from previous models. The battery life is much better! I previously had an S3. Everything that I loved about my S3 is still here but greatly improved upon. I also love that there is greater control of running applications  which is a huge power saver - if you are new to Android, you'll want to take advantage of that.|on March 10, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1004|I know this review is alittle late in the ball game with the S6 about to be launched...but this is one of the better phones that Samsung has created.  Compared to the S3 that I recently had, this is definitely an upgrade. The size is not overly large and I can still operate it with one hand.  It fits nicely in my hand and is quite beautiful.  The S5 runs smoothly and the processor is definitely faster.  It takes great pictures in daylight but I must say I am still trying to figure out how to truly take advantage of the digital image stabilization function.  I have noticed that sometimes some pictures will turn out a little blurry and I have to retake to get those clear pictures.  Not to say that the camera is a bad camera, but I have to get used to it.  The front facing camera leaves little to be desired.  Overall, I would say this is a keeper.|on March 9, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1008|As an Apple user, I was hesitant to buy a product that I knew I wouldn't be familiar with. I grew up with mac computers, and the first and only smart phone I owned until now was an iPhone 4. I liked my iPhone a lot, but was ready for something more customizable an flexible- and that is exactly what I got in the Samsung Galaxy S5. I am not super tech-savvy, so this review will be pretty basic, but maybe it will help those of you that are like me and just want a good phone that is easy to use. So here are my pros and cons: I'll start with the cons (they are few and far between): -When I first got the phone, the battery drained very quickly, despite the many reviews raving about how good the S5's battery life is. As soon as I downloaded Battery Doctor, that problem was resolved. My battery now lasts a good two days without me needing to charge it. - The finger print scanner and heart monitor kind of suck. But these are not necessities so whatever. -The phone came with a lot of apps that suck up power that I will never use. This may be different for other users, and it is simple to delete what you don't want. -Sometimes, the phone gets very hot (I've only noticed this a few times when I was charging it. Make sure that it is out in the open when charging, not under a pillow or blanket or stack of papers or anything like that). Now for the Pro's: -The phone is freaking beautiful. It's slim and pretty and the AMOLED display is breathtaking. Everything is sharp and vibrant and the screen is huge. -The phone is big. For me, this is a pro, but for those of you with small hands this may be a con. I have big hands and big pockets, so this doesn't bother me. -It takes beautiful photos. Yes, the colors are more saturated than real-life but I like this. Others may not, but I think the photos are great. -It is easy to learn how to use. As mac owner and ex-iPhone-user, I was worried that it would be difficult for me to learn how to use the S5 and android. It was not. Everything is very intuitive. -You are able to expand the memory of the phone. With an iPhone, this is not possible, but with the S5, you have the option to put a micro SD card into the phone to expand your memory. One problem that i had which was quite annoying was that when I first got the phone, every time I pressed the "home" button, it would go to google search instead of home. I figure this was because the phone was lagging so much that it interpreted me pressing the home button as a long press, which brings up google. I did a quick search online and found a post that told me to take out the battery while the phone was still on, hold the power button for a minute or two, put the battery back in and reboot the phone, and tah dah. The problem was gone. There are probably many more pro's that I could talk about, and many more that I haven't found yet, but the bottom line is that this phone is beautiful, functional, and very easy to use. I will never buy an iPhone again.|on March 8, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1035|Samsung makes excellent phones with outstanding features. My only complaint is the battery life is just not as good as my last phone. Considering it is competing in that regard with a Razr maxx, it probably isn't as bad as I think it is. It does lasts through the day with moderate use, and only rarely do I need to give it some juice on the ride home from work in the evening. The screen quality is amazing, the sound is above average, and I have yet to have any problems with it, knock on wood.|on March 4, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

1037|I love this phone! It is miles better than my old android. Anything I need from a smartphone this phone delivers. I wouldn't switch to another because of what the S5 offers.  Let me list some of my personal cons and pros just to keep this review informative. Pros Battery life, processor speed, expandable storage, multitasking,  screen is outstanding, slim, amazing camera and vídeo, the fact it is gold (colored), the android platform, water resistant, USB 3.0, fingerprint scanner, nfc, among others Cons I could do without touch wiz, lots of useless samsung apps you have to deal with, the build quality could have been better but still nice, The pros definitely outweigh the cons for me. Even though the next batch of smartphones is rolling in, this phone still competes. And for the price you can't go wrong.  So yes I highly recommend this phone.|on March 3, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1038|I really really wanted to like this phone. It has a gorgeous screen, a speedy browser, and I've grown quite fond of the fingerprint scanner.  So why do I keep having to restrain myself from running over this thing with my car?  The S5 has a tendency to do what it wants rather than function under the settings/modes you've programmed.  Want to be embarrassed at meetings and seminars?  Set the phone on 'mute' and wait a few minutes till it randomly unmutes itself and starts dinging (or worse yet, ringing) when it is supposed to be on silent.  This is a well-documented problem with the phone (according to Sprint and also a quick internet search). Sprint makes no apologies for this, and won't really do anything about it.  It's even more fun if you use the S5 as an alarm clock, and you're woken up in the middle of the night by text message notifications.  I've tried all kinds of silence apps and the phone rings through all of them.  The interesting thing its, now it's taken to only working on vibrate mode when my alarm clock is supposed to go off and ring through the silence mode.  The other problem I'm having with it is that the screen automatically lights up when the phone is fully charged. This is really fun when it's 3 am and you're trying to get some sleep.  I've started turning it face down on the nightstand so at least it's somewhat dampened when it inevitably goes on by itself. The people complaining about the camera are also spot-on.  The phone takes BEAUTIFUL pictures - occasionally, if you are very lucky, and if it feels like focusing that day.  Otherwise, prepare for much frustration trying to take photos of something that is a foot in front of you but that the camera just won't focus on. I am truly sorry I bought this unit, even more so now that I have to wait nearly a year to get a different phone.  Unfortunately, Sprint is no longer interested in customer retention, and my 15+ years as a customer doesn't count for anything with regard to resolving the situation.  There are a lot of other great phones out there - do yourself a favor and get something else.|on March 3, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

1043|Purchased this through Amazon at a better price than my carrier offered, so I was happy about this phone right off the bat. I bought this for my wife to replace her aging Razr M. She was hesitant, thinking that the larger phone would be too big for her small hands, But since using it, she's come to like it. The resolution, processor speed, and camera were all a great step up from her previous Android. She loves this phone, so for me, thats worth a 5 star review.|on March 2, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1044|Was really wanting to get an iPhone 6 but, after comparing it to the Galaxy S5, could not justify the cost, especially with all the complaints about the fragile glass screen vs the S5's gorilla glass. Love the S5's display, screen size, and the fact that it is water and dust resistant.  A little disappointed in the camera and video vs the iPhone 6. The iPhone 6 appears to take better photos and video stabilization on the iPhone is better. The S5's camera functions are not as user friendly as the iPhone 6's. The S5's fingerprint scanner is more of a pain than a desirable feature. Disabled the fingerprint scanner after a week of use. Enabled the face recognition feature that is supposed to keep the display on as long as the phone detects you are looking at the screen but have yet to figure out how to make it work properly. Battery life is awesome. Lot of apps that come with the phone that cannot be uninstalled. Good phone but it has its quirks that can be frustrating until you get used to them. Most people would not have the patience to take a month or so to get used to a phone's idiosyncrasies.|on March 2, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars
1045|I love my new phone. Great product, and much better price point than I could get at the Verizon store. Great features, great screen, and it is water resistant, so I can use it while whitewater rafting. Soooooo much better than my old droid.|on March 2, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1046|Ok. I waited to write a review because I wanted to give it some time. First off. I literally washed my phone in a full washing cycle soap and all. Yesterday. Oops! My phone survived!!!!!!! I can't believe it. If u are worried about water damge, this phone is your best bet. Unbelievable! I put it in a regular heavy duty washer and it is ok. Crazy!!!

1047|I was happy to receive my phone in great condition. For the price and the fact that it is in great condition just as noted, I am definitely happy. I love this phone, I've always been a Galaxy user, last phone was the S3, and I am so happy with the S5. Only thing was it didn't come with a charger, and when I received it, it was dead... so it was a few hours before I could turn it on, which only made the anticipation worse!! :D|on March 2, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1077|Be careful of some of the default settings. I was using up all my data in the first couple months and couldn't figure out why. Apparently it was set to switch back and forth from using data to wifi; whichever was strongest. Turn that off if you don't have unlimited data! The other thing that was a minus, was how BIG it is. With smaller hands, it can be tricky to maneuver. There is a neat screen swipe feature where you can minimize the size of your screen so you can use it one handed, but it doesn't actually make it any easier for me. Maybe it works if your hands are bigger? It's a nice phone. I got it in white and was sad to have to put a cover on it because it's so pretty!|on February 25, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

1079|Tldr: this phone is great. I went from an LG_g2 to this phone. While I still really miss the back buttons of the lg phone, I love this phone. It's pretty great and reliable. Im not going to get into specs and all that. Use a Samsung review guide to set it up and it'll be a great phone. I'll go straight to minor negative things so people can see that stuff. But pretty much I'm not returning it and buying a G3 so I'm clearly happy. Things I don't like: the stock keyboard. It sucks and isn't intuitive, I just downloaded Swype instead. The stock samsung messaging service. It doesn't break up the messages for Verizon (a cdma limitation) so you can't really use it on Verizon because it'll limit each message to 160 characters. The cover for the charger. It's annoying and a little old flip phone ish feeling. The tiny mechanism that keeps it closed fails pretty quickly. I suspect it'll break after a year and I'll just rip it off. This will also deplete the value of resell. The home screen doesn't carousel around. When you get to the edge of the home screen you can't rearrange things and or flip to the back of the home screens from the first. You have to scroll left or right all the way to the back. Makes it a bit annoying to get to programs I don't use frequently enough to be on the home screen or one screen over and, subsequently, I use them even less from forgetting about them. While I'm at it, there is less ability to customize the widgets and their sizes, home page layouts, and freedom to tweak in general. Also I wish the home keys were more customizable like the lg had been. Would have made use more comfortable for a left handed person. Highly recommend a ballistic case for this or any expensive smart phone.|on February 25, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

(Even AC). We have toddlers and our normal remotes get lost all the time. It's fast, light and has some pretty neat extras. Ordered refurbished and looks brand new.

1088|My first smartphone was a MyTouch 4G.  It was an ok phone, but it crashed a lot and had to be sent in for repairs 4 times over its 2 year lifespan.  My second smartphone was an iPhone 5.  My wife and I both loved them!  No issues whatsoever.  The phones never crashed.  Ever.  But my wife and I really didn't like that you can't expand their memory and that you're tied down to using one computer to manage all of your songs (we have 3 different Mac home computers with different song collections on each).  So...we decided to make the switch to an S5 because Sprint had a $1 upgrade deal.  I did my due diligence.  I read all the online reviews and they all said that the iPhone 6 and the S5 were neck-and-neck.  However, we found the S5 SORELY lacking. Pros:  big, bold, vibrant screen well-built and solid in the hand OS much more stable than when I had my MyTouch 4G Cons:  NOT easy to manage songs on a Mac...you have to use special software...and it crashes a lot 64gb expansion card only $20...128gb expansion card $100!!!!!!!! for us, the phone crashes a lot...we have to restart it at least 2 times per week for us, it's too big...it hurts my fingers, hand, and wrist by the end of the day (not easy to use one-handed) there's only one vibrate mode...iphone has 10 or more different ways to vibrate the phone the speaker (I think there's only one) is not loud my daughter is 3...with the iPhone, we could understand her every word in phone and speaker mode...with the S5, she's unintelligible speakerphone on the loudest volume is not that loud For us, the cons WAY outweigh the pros.  We'll be going back to iPhones when our 2 years with these phones are up. **Update:  we've had the phones for about 5 months now.  We really don't like them.  It's very time-consuming to get mp3s from our macs onto the phones, the Swype typing is wrong 50% of the time, the speaker volume is SO low (even on the highest setting), and battery life isn't any better than our iPhone 5s. **Final Update:  we hated these phones so much we switched carriers to get iPhone 5s's.  This is just our personal opinion, but for my wife and I, we will never switch from iPhones again.|on February 24, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

1090|So far so good. Have had it 2 months. It's a phone and I'm not that techy. I works and I like the features, except for the heart rate. I never works for me.|on February 23, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars
1091|Fast, smooth, compatible with any and every app on the playstore market, and affordable with contract. No longer have to wait for Wifi to connect (almost instantly when key is entered), for a game to load (wicked quick with snapdragon), or for a call to be placed (enough memory to push aside running apps and make that darn call). Stock emoticons and messaging software is very nice, but can only be utilized with people who have a Galaxy. Compatibility with both apps and hardware is the highest with Samsung. If you are looking for a speaker attachment, custom case, or new game, the S5 will be the standard for it. Charges insanely fast with stock cord (has an extra piece that the usb minis do not, but will still charge with a mini) and keeps life all day + unless heavy gaming/texting. GPS has 3 modes to provide better accuracy. Booting and rebooting only takes about 30 seconds with this phone. I never like to run with the crowd and have the latest and greatest (usually like to give the underdog a chance), but in this case I took a chance and do not regret it at all.|on February 23, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1096|The phone seems fine, but as a convert from apple devices, I'm immensely disappointed with how non-user friendly it is to bring my music over. After hearing all the hype about "the switch", and how easy it is, it looks like a bait-and-switch to me. There doesn't appear to be any non-pay service that allows you to bring over playlists, and the only way to bring your music over is to drag and drop. As somebody with an iTunes library of over 100 GB, this is ridiculous for me to sort through. Sadly, I will likely continue using my iPod touch as a companion to my S5, which I find to be a pathetic comprimise I have to make. As somebody who like to listen to music, I have a hard time recommending this phone.|on February 22, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

1100|Certainly flexible, adaptable and able to use all the software we need.  I don't care if it will be out of date in a few months like all electronics.  Faster and bigger than this would do nothing for me.  With my big fingers, this is just as good as a 7" tablet.  I respect the modularity of being able to change sd memory, battery.  Installed virus protection from Verizon and using their cloud.  Don't have a need for Google cloud for additional backup.  Was hoping Google Hangouts would advance to become a full competitor for Apple Facetime and Skype.  Anyhow, Google Maps continues to excel.  Battery time on standby much better than I expected.  I don't use the earbuds that came with the phone.  Otherwise, sound, camera just fine and the Gallery organization is helpful.|on February 22, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1109|(Her husband writes this.)  I am one who uses my phone most for: texting, phone, Facebook, web searching.  Coming off of a Nokia Windows phone (which I loved, but could not load many apps that were just for android or iPhone) it took me a while to get it set up and add apps that I wanted.  I do recommend that anyone who gets this phone search on the web to find what pre-installed apps might serve worthy of uninstallation. I was impressed, and still am, at how fast it operates and have had absolutely no glitches so far.  If I am careful to be sure all apps I am not using are closed down, my battery level does quite well.  It is 8:30 pm right now and I first used my phone at 6:30 am; the battery is still at 68%. I shop a Amazon on my phone as easily as on my pc (a recommended app). If I were a real techy, I might have other things to say.  The only downer is the usage of S Voice.  On my Nokia, I was accustomed to be able to hear that I had a text, tell my phone to read it, compose a text reply and send it - all without taking my phone from its holster on my belt or averting my eyes from the road.  As far as I can tell so far, I cannot do the same on this one. Supposedly, there is a way to do it, but I still have not figured it out. Further, mine is one of the multitude that will not connect to my ear Bluetooth device.  It is paired with my computer via Bluetooth and I have sent files that way from one to the other.  S Voice is great for asking questions and getting a fast answer. Compared to my Nokia, composing email is easier on this phone since one can tap on the screen anywhere in the message to edit.  Also, many often-used symbols are available on the primary keyboard.  If you like to use swipe, or would like to try it, it can be enabled. Because of the touchless messaging issue and Bluetooth problem, I would like to give this only 4.4 stars.|on February 19, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1111|So far, it is working great after several months.  I love that if I play Clash of Clans which is a battery hog, I can kick it into Ultra Power Saving mode and have all the battery I need for the essentials.  So far, it is the only phone that has this unique black & white Ultra power save mode.|on February 19, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1114|I have had the S5 for a year now, I bought very fast not knowing the differences.  First of all I have compared this phone to everything out there, but I didn't know to compare it to the S5 models that are available.  Here is the reason for two stars, It would be Five Stars if it had more than 16GB internal memory.  I only have a few apps, I bought a 64 GB mini SD Card for music and photo storage not realizing it will take up 128 GB card.  Go ahead and get the 128 mini SD card (External Memory).  The phone wants to update software (internal Memory) as it needs to, but it says not enough space on internal memory.  So I started checking out the problem because again I don't have that many apps., what I discovered was I should have bought or held out for the 32 or 64 GB internal memory model that some carriers don't carry yet. Search it out, the phone is awesome, but is really memory starved. Having said all this, it's the best phone I ever had.  Never has froze up and runs fast still.|on February 18, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars
1115|For the most part I enjoy using the phone and it does what it is asked. I am deducting 2 stars so that potential buyers that may have the same concerns that I do can find the issues that I had and make a better informed buying decision. The phone itself works fine. Some issues and complaints. Phone cannot send MMS over wifi, device has to be connected to carrier network. Phone has not been rooted since ATT Android Version 4.4.2. Proprietary charging cable (meaning it is a Samsung specific connection). Comes with alot of bloatware from carrier that is difficult or impossible to remove/disable without root. My phone was plagued with the broken camera issue, which Samsung fixed under warranty. While at Samsung for repair, the techs automatically upgraded the phone to the most current version of Andriod, while I had been declining the updates.Those would be my biggest gripes. Other than that phone works as expected in my experience.|on February 18, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

1127|Galaxy S5 Phone has a defect where lens protrudes and therefore if you place the phone down, lens is likely to shatter.  Also, there are some very annoying features on this phone, including: constantly telling me that I am raising the volume too high and may cause ear damage, let me but the decider on that, not nanny-Samsung; the charger area cover on the bottom of the phone is built shoddily and mine broke off, rendering my $700.00 phone no longer "Waterproof". Battery life is sub optimal due to all the Samsung bloatware they have jammed on the phone; no one wants all the garbage software Samsung offers so please just delete it (oh wait, you can't you can disable it, thereby utilizing valuable memory!).  The phone in general has a very cheap feel to it and is not a high quality good product.  I highly recommend you look elsewhere.|on February 16, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

1135|I've been using Samsung devices for 5 years now, though I tried some other competitors...on and off. Nothing compares to quality of Samsung. Yes it has bloatware  but that's minor. The S5 has been dependable for me without even one problem so far. I would buy this phone again if I was looking for another replacement.|on February 15, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1139|Package arrived on time, and I was excitingly opening the box, everything was pristine, but...there was no manual! For a device this advanced, I certainly expected something more than just a fold out quick guide on how to text, receive calls and to follow on-screen prompts. There are entire books written on this phone! So, I guess I'm left to YouTube, and - apparently - getting one of those books. Which leaves this to be an unfinished review. however, I am excited to get to know this phone, eventually.|on February 15, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

1155|So many things to love about my new phone! Screen is big, but I have no problem even operating one-handed. Colors are so bright, but you can choose between 5 different effects for your screen. Extremely fast...have downloaded numerous apps and has made no difference in the speed. If you're familiar with android os, you can use the standard mode of the setup wizard.  If you're a beginner with cell phones,  or just not very tech savvy,  there's an easy mode. The preloaded S-Health app is awesome! Let's you track weight,  exercise, food (like a food diary - you can even add pics for each meal!), stress levels,  and others.You can set goals and track progress. It also includes an app called "Coach". One of the first things I saw when using my phone the first time was the numbers across the top of the keyboard. No more having to toggle back and forth all the time! A small thing to some,  but I think it's pretty cool! I got it in white and I think it's pretty darn cute! And the unbelievable,  unbeatable price of $49!! I had absolutely no problem signing on for a 2 year contract. Did I say I loved my new Galaxy S5?|on February 13, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1156|I received this phone and tried to transfer my info from old phone, had issues. I then called Sprint and they said that this phone was still registered to someone else and could not be used on my Sprint account. Now my Sprint account is screwed up and Sprint says I am not eligible for an upgrade even tho this phone was returned. Amazon has to reset my Sprint account because Sprint won't!!!

1185|Love it more every day. Never owned a smart phone before and scary at first. One thing I learned fast and hope it helps some poor soul like myself is make sure you are connected to wifi whenever possible instead of using your on phone plan. Especially when you are doing updates or installing apps. This phone is a comfortable size, very user friendly, takes great pictures and easy for texting. Make sure you get a case when you purchase it. This a must site for you if this is your first smart phone. http://www.verizonwireless.com/simulator/Samsung/galaxy_s5_kk/index.php#FEATURE_PHONE_SILENT|on February 7, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1186|This is the fourth Android phone model we've used in our household used since evolving into smart phone use six years ago. Before I begin gushing about the phone itself, some context about *any* mobile phone purchase (if you're already comfortable with the variables of mobile phones and their providers, you can skip this part): These major factors that will contribute to (or detract from) the smart phone experience of *any* user: (1) the hardware...the phone itself (2) operating system software (3) installed applications (4) the network (overall, and where you happen to be using the phone at a particular time) (5) the service provider. Serial dependencies come from these factors, as many phones are tied to specific operating systems or service providers. Just remember that even if you make a great phone choice, deficiencies in the other areas can still diminish your overall user experience. Make your move to your next (or first) smart phone only after researching these choices. Which provider? Which mobile operating system? Who offers the best service, or the best combination of value and service? The rest of this review assumes you've already figured out why a phone with the Android operating system might be a better choice for you than an iPhone, a Blackberry or a Windows-based smart phone solution (yes, Blackberry and Windows options remain alive...sort of). Every provider --including Sprint-- has a variety of pricing options. If you're a Sprint customer with two years on your current hardware and are ready to re-up: many phones are available at a deep discount from both online retailers and big box stores. I've asked Sprint if they will match those prices..and they won't. It's no big deal; you won't hurt their feelings if you buy from another source (but you might not be able to take a suddenly balky phone into a Sprint store and have it replaced at no charge, either). For this phone, Amazon's pricing was at a 90% discount vs. buying from Sprint. Be sure and negotiate with them and look for plan pricing discounts for loyatly or organizational/corporate affiliations. For the phone itself: this is an outstanding device for each of telephony, online activity, still photography and video capture. The display is crisp and brilliant, the controls (each of the three buttons on the phone's side, the home/soft keys on the front and the options within the OS) are intuitive and responsive. The touchscreen keyboard is the best onscreen text input experience I've ever had...period. Audio output (for phone calls and music --streamed via Bluetooth or via the aux connector) is excellent. Both photographs and video are easy to use. The 16 megapixel rear camera images (still and moving) are outstanding in quality. Obviously the front is a grainier at 2 megapixels. But wait there's more: the rear phone cover easily removes to reveal an easily user-replaceable battery. Shame on phones that don't offer this. You'll also find access to a slot for a microSD card adjacent to the battery. Charging and sync are via a USB 3.0 port. If you don't have any cables with this form factor, this phone ships with one, but you'll want extras so you don't have to keep tabs on a possible single point of failure. This is not a negative...bust an issue if you replacing a phone with a different cable type. Outstanding smart phone that will keep you from the clutches of the Apple tree.

1189|I am using the Samsung S5 Verizon daily for 6 months and find it a decent phone. Pros: - great display - fast processor - good battery life (my first LTE phone that can stream music through the whole workday) - battery can be replaced (batteries available everywhere) - finally (Feb 2015, Verizon) an Android Lollipop update arrived that fixes security issues - has external SD card (same location as SIM card) - Loudness and quality via earphones (wire and bluetooth) is great (bluetooth problems have been fixed) - Android Wear watch (Samsung Gear Live) works great with this phone Cons: - device encryption excludes screen unlock via fingerprint reader - flimsy USB port flap broke within two month (spare part is available via Amazon and can be installed easily) - pulse sensor is useless (use a Garmin ANT chest strap instead) - problem for all phones with Android 4.4 or newer: access to SD card is very restricted i.e. only Samsung file manager can access all files. Many Apps cannot deal with it correctly. So it gets crowded in the 16GB internal memory. - Lots of useless pre-installed apps that cannot be uninstalled, is a security risk and wastes resource. At least those apps can be deactivated through the Application Manager. In summary a wast improvement over previous Samsung LTE phones (battery, display). I do not give it 5 stars mostly because of the useless fingerprint sensor/screen unlock which annoys me on a daily base.|on February 6, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

1206|This was a gift for my wife and she is totally satisfied with all aspects of this item|on February 4, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1207|This is the best phone I have ever had.  It has tons of features, a killer camera, and expandable memory.  It is far smoother and more responsive than the Galaxy S3 it replaced, and that's saying a lot.  The camera packs more pixels than my DSLR, and it takes video in 4k resolution.  The difference, however, between the two phones is most apparent in the display:  full 1080p resolution with amazingly vibrant colors.  While the construction is largely plastic, that is not entirely a bad thing.  The phone is very light in the hand, yet tough enough to withstand reasonable falls without shattering to bits, unlike the iPhone.  Android as a platform is also incredibly customizable.  You can set up your phone exactly to your own preferences, not some designer's notion of what they should be.  This is truly a great phone at an amazing price.|on February 4, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1211|I love my Samsung period. =)|on February 3, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1212|The phone start giving me problems after 1 month. The phone become unbearable hot and I have no apps running (GPS is off) It starts to freeze when I'm on a phone call. It freezes on the unlock screen. The only way to get it to work again is to pull out the battery, and let it cool down and start over again. I would not recommend this phone. I have notified verizon and samsung about the freezing issue and haven't gotten a response back from them. Samsung's quality isn't there like their earlier galaxy models.|on February 3, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

1215|Great phone at a good price.  Still learning how to use all of the new features!|on February 3, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1216|Great phone. This is my second in the galaxy line and I have enjoyed them both. Though the cases are plastic, they are quite sturdy and the finish dimpled to help with dropping it. The display is super sharp (love TV on it!) and as with all androids, you can set it up the way you want. I find the settings and such easy to use - havent' had any issues. Call quality is good without dropping a lot of calls. Speakers are loud enough to make calls and watch videos. Tons of available apps. And the best part of this one is the added water resistance. Only drawback for me is it doesn't fit in hand, or pocket, or.....the sucker is just big.|on February 2, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1221|Best smartphone I've ever owned. Lots of features for battery saving. The camera is absolutely the best and the reason I bought the phone. The design is great albeit plasticky and cheap besides the screen but a good case will fix that. The waterproof body is a big plus for me since I have a habit of trying to photograph in the rain. Love, love, love this phone. Planning on buying the next Galaxy in the future.|on January 31, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1222|I asked some really smart tech guys what phone they recommended and they said the S5 or the Note 4. So I went out and fondled them at Sam's Club but they only had a few at the deal price. I looked on Amazon and was able to get a super cyber week deal. I am still learning my way around this phone but it has been great so far.|on January 31, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1223|very happy|on January 31, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1224|This phone do not need a recommendation because it stand way in front of the other phone make and I had used the other ones. Is very quick responsive and very good on battery life, very clear and strong screen. I had a Samsung LED TV and a tablet too and that was part of the reason for purchase the Galaxy S5 and I will only buy samsung's. Very easy to set-up and transfer everything from my previous phone(droid maxx). I would definitively recommend this Samsung Galaxy S5!!!!!!!!!!!!!|on January 30, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1225|Much better than the Galaxy S3 I was so used to.  I was on the fence about getting the Galaxy S5 or the iPhone 6.  I have a Mac, iPad and iPod and still selected the Galaxy phone because of the following benefits: Expandable Memory - You can put a Mini SD card in the Galaxy to increase the storage space.  You cannot with the iPhone. Removable Battery - In some cases, you may want to or need to take the battery out of your phone.  You cannot with the iPhone. Camera Quality - The Galaxy has a slight advantage with the cameras built into the phone. Water Resistant - I am outdoors a lot and using my phone around water a lot so it's something that I thought would be a huge plus.  I didn't want to put on a bulky case for water resistance; the Galaxy is water resistant and the iPhone is not. All in all, I really like the S5.  I just wish I could have waited a little longer to get the S6!|on January 30, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1247|It's a Galaxy s5 from Sprint.  Any oddities I've have had with this phone are on Sprint, not Amazon.  It's as good as Sprint gets, which isn't all that good now, is it?|on January 27, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars
1248|Galaxy S5 has excellent screen resolution, speakerphone quality is very good, and camera takes great pictures, even in low light. Large screen supports large keypads making it easier to enter numbers and data.  Battery lasts 2 days for me, but I don't use that many apps. Ordering thru Amazon was easy and phones work fine.|on January 27, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

1256|I had the Samsung Galaxy 3 prior to getting the S5, so I am quite familiar with this device. I am a big fan of Samsung Galaxy phones, but the only downside I feel the S5 has it that the speaker phone doesn't seem as good at the 3 I previously had and the picture quality seems poorer. Other than those two things the phone is amazing.|on January 25, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

1259|NOT AS GOODS AS IPAD. The displays are truncated : Amazon product descriptions, for example, display only the first few characters, whereas the iPad  displays the entire description .  Also, on the ipad,  you can set your homepage to your favorite (newspaper,bank or facebook) page.

1267|Features on this phone were great, but the whole design felt cheap due to almost all plastic components.  Returned and upgraded for the Galaxy Note 3 which has a metal bezel and a little more heft.|on January 23, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars
1268|I was not really sure about the phone; always thinking that at least had the chance to send it back if it had not meet my expectations. Happily I must admit that I love the phone, I first I thought it was a little overpriced but the truth is that although described as: "good condition", the phone was very close to "pristine" condition. Yes, I'm happy.|on January 23, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1269|An excellent phone at a great price with a two year contract though Verizon.  Purchasing a cell phone on Amazon.com was simple and hassle free with no salesman pressure. Super fast shipping also.|on January 23, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1271|great phone, great battery life.  Coming from a Galaxy S3 or S4 into the S5 is very easy to transition. Familiar function with higher capacities and options.|on January 22, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1272|I'm not very impressed. The S5 is just an S2 with a few more features. If I could have kept my old phone, I would have saved, and stayed happy. I feel I was tricked into an upgrade when my S2 started failing with "Charging Paused, Voltage too high" issue. (without a charger connected)  I suppose the water tight case is a big improvement, as is the larger screen. Functionally, I see no improvement.  I have had to uninstall several apps because of the phone not responding or locking up.  Not sure if it is was a memory issue or a application issue.  Clicking cancel or home had no affect. Sometimes smaller is better...?|on January 22, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

1287|This phone sucks! The battery dies after a day of very limited use. The Android OS while still way better than ios from apple left me missing my wp8 from my previous phone that cost less than $100 new. The only reason I got this phone is because the rep at the at&t store was convinced that this was the best phone out there. This may be the case but if you are looking to have a phone that dies every day (while in power save mode) go ahead and waste your money on this baby. The next step is switching to grayscale display  and losing the 4g and or Wifi so i can use the phone if I forget to plug it in each and every day. The call quality also sucks really bad. If you are in a vehicle, forget about having a conversation with anyone. My wife has the same phone and we can't make out what the other is saying if they are in a car. Sounds like the other person is under water. Camera is okay (this was one of the big selling points from the at&t guy). The thing that really makes the camera frustrating for me is the 2-3 seconds it takes to actually snap the shot after you press the shutter button. I have missed most of the shots that I wanted to capture because of this. The photo quality  (once the slow ass phone decides to snap the picture) is good but so was my old .99c windows phone. Size: I don't really like the larger size either. I find  yself dropping the phone more because it doesn't fit my hand as well as smaller phones. Plus it takes up your whole pocket and can be a pain to get out if you are sitting. The list of things I hate about this phone go on but I pointed out the biggies for me I would still buy this phone over any iPhone mostly due to the crappy iecosystem that has your brand new iPhone feel the same as your first generation iPhone and after 8-10 fraudulent charges of $200 or more from the iTunes crap that you have no choice but to link your cc to your phone. Save your money on this one!|on January 20, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

1293|Amazon has completly wow'ed me. I have to use my personal phone for work, and when my Galaxy 3 died, I was stuck. I ordered this on a Friday morning, and by 11:30am Saturday I had my new phone. And shipping was in no way expensive. Phone wise, it is a step up in visual quality and durability than the 3, with a few more bells and whistles. The battery life is much, much longer, and the heart rate monitor is a fun function. The 3.0 usb port speeds up charging, but will charge with a 2.0 plug.16mp camera is clear and the sport photo option works very well.|on January 20, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1305|the absolute only complaint I have with this phone is why there are no screen covers or stylus or a great case as a part of the package with this phone - all of which are easily purchased on Amazon and I have, but this phone is so darn good that it needs to come with some of the extras as an added bonus. I love this phone, it is the greatest thing since I got my dog and my other best friend besides my dog. The only warning I have is that when your dog paws the phone, the dog will inevitably open the internet on the phone and do some Google search, or the dog will end up calling someone from your past that you never wanted to hear from again.  I even caught my dog turning on my solitaire game on the phone one afternoon when I turned my head away from less than 30 seconds.|on January 18, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1308|Phone is great, no complaints against Samsung. Annoyed with Amazon, though, regarding Amazon Prime Instant Video not working. (It's not the phone's fault.) More info: [...] Over the course of the past few years, many websites have begun offering up a mobile-friendly HTML 5 version of their content. Videos that once required Adobe's Flash can now be played on any modern mobile web browser. Yet a stubborn set of sites hold steadfast onto the past, as with Amazon's Instant Video service, rendering their content inaccessible on a stock Samsung Galaxy S5. But with the help of Mozilla's Firefox browser and a side-loaded Flash installer, you can still access this content from your GS5.|on January 18, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1311|I works better than I anticipated. The screen is very clear and sharp. It is much faster than my old Motorola Zoom. I find my time in front of my PC has been reduced by about 80% or more!! The power for these hand held devices is amazing. The S Voice function is very handy especially when paired to the Alpine system in my truck via Bluetooth.  Battery life seems good. I was using it almost all day when I first got it. Played with all the features. Sat at the PC with the owners manual on the monitor and the S5 in my hand. the battery got down the 28% one day. That was as low as I have seen it. This is a great device -- much more than just a phone. Would recommend it to anyone.|on January 17, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1315|I am absolutely loving this phone! By far my favorite phone to date. I would buy again in a heartbeat Overall: I love the design and build quality of the phone. This dust/water resistance is a nice touch for a person that might expose their phone to the elements a little bit. The hardware in the phone keeps it running very snappy. The battery also lasts quite a while as well.  With a case and a screen protector, this thing is very durable. It has survived a couple of drops by me already. I have had it for over 6 months now and could not be happier. Usually after a little while with a phone I'm itching for a change, but I really enjoy this one. Pros: - Design and build quality are top notch - Android App Support - Syncs well with smart TVs and Tablets - Battery life (also removable, which is nice) - Dust/Water Resistant - Durable (has held up to a few drops already without problem) - MicroSD slot for added storage - Camera takes great photos Cons: - A bit on the expensive side yet (also for a top end phone, it's right on par)|on January 17, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1318|First time buying a phone through Amazon and not going to Verizon. Couldn't be happier with the decision. Price was $50 versus buying from Verizon for $200. Activation was simple and there aren't any hidden charges. You will have to pay for an upgrade fee but you have to pay that no matter where you buy. You do have to make sure you keep you phone line with Verizon for 6 months or you will pay a fee to Amazon but if you are looking for cheaper way to upgrade your phone I would recommend this route. On to the phone, my wife loves the phone. She has been using an iPhone for the past 4 years and finally switched over and can't be happier with the phone. It took her some time to transition but now that she is comfortable with how the phone works she stated she wouldn't go back to iPhone.|on January 16, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1319|I had to replace my first generation Samsung S4 when Sprint switched over to the Sprint Spark program.  I was LIVID my S4 was only a month old.  Needles to say I was not happy about buying a phone that I did not want.  That said I fell in love with the S5 almost instantly.  For me the big score was not the increased size, the thumbprint scanner,  or any of the updated features in the program of the phone.  For me the love affair was in the water resistant feature.  I ruined my Galaxy I, II, and III due to water issues!  I have taken this phone in the shower with me numerous times, I live in Oregon were rain and phones have generally not mixed until now!  I took off a star because of the design issue with the charging port door.  I have already had to replace it and I have had the phone less than a year.  Without this important little door the phone is not water resistant.  I also took off another for the plastic faux metal around the phone.  My paint is flaking off and it doesn't look very nice.  Other than those two small issues I love this phone and am happy that the S4 died with Sparks.|on January 16, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

1323|Got this for my fiancé for Christmas.  I have an iPhone 5S and have been an iPhone user for quite some time and I'm pretty jelly.  He has app for using his phone to control all of the tv's in the home plus he is able to control his Oknyo surround sound system with it.  I tried setting that up on my iPhone but could never get it to work properly.  It has great resolution, the screen is quite large, and I kind of like the default "water droplet" sounds it makes when you're tapping on it.  He hasn't voiced a complaint about it yet and that's saying a lot!  :)|on January 14, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1325|What a Great Phone !!  I love my S5, the color is beautiful,!!  I had the S3 but I wanted a larger screen. The S5  has a nice size screen..  It was hard  to decide which case to get. I did not want to take away from the beauty of the phone. I found  a case that looks  like the  case..|on January 14, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1327|awesome phone, got 50 bucks off of it on amazon. if you really want a in depth review I recommend reading online reviews from tech websites and testing it out in a store. wouldn't have enough characters here to have a complete review.|on January 13, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1328|This phone has been reviewed to death, so I will not bother reviewing all the small details. I did, however, notice that no reviews mention wakelocks, so I would like to take a moment to discuss those. I will also tie this into the battery and battery life. At home, my S5 has amazing battery life. I consistently get nearly 6 hrs. of screen on time with a single charge. However, at school (a large university) my battery life takes a nose dive while on wifi. A tl;dr explanation of what is happening is that the android operating system has a bug where busy wifi networks are able to wake your phone up while it is sleeping (keyword: wake locks). This means your phone cannot go into a consistent "deep sleep" after you lock your phone and it will continue to drain your battery even when you're not using it. Feel free to google it for more info, but as of now, there is no fix. A quick fix for me was to download an app called MacroDroid. I set it so that when I am connected to my university network and I lock the screen, it will automatically shut the wifi off. When I turn the screen back on, the wifi is turned on automatically. Disclaimer: I am running kitkat right now, lollipop may or may not fix this issue. Related to this is a problem my S5 seems to have when I change specific things. For example, both after installing a microSD card and syncing my text messages from my old iphone to my current phone, the phone would not go into a deep sleep. I was able to fix these issues by clearing my phones cache and clearing the cache for the associated apps. I've always been able to fix this issue, but I feel like it shouldn't be happening at all in the first place. If anyone cares to know, I will describe how to prolong your battery life below, both on a day to day basis and its lifetime overall. To extend day to day battery life: 1. I immediately turned off all gestures (apparently they can get toggled while the phone is in your pocket and use up battery?) 2. Turn off location unless I'm using it 3. Disabled all the random apps that come preloaded on the phone and you can't delete If you are having issues with your phone's battery life, try using Greenify, which will let you hibernate apps that may use up battery with one click. You can also download an app called "System Monitor" (the Lite version is free and works fine for this purpose) and you can use it to monitor the CPU speed on your S5. If, while the phone is locked, the phone is not in "deep sleep," something is wrong and it will cause your battery to die faster than it should. Note: The first time you turn on the phone and as the phone is installing all the initial updates, the battery will probably drain very fast. This is only because the phone has been off for a long time and the calibration (so to speak) will be a little off. After you charge your phone completely it should go back to a normal discharge rate. To extend the overall lifetime of your phone's battery: 1. Do not leave it in your car when it is very hot (> 80F) or very cold (<35F). It can do irreversible damage to the battery. 2. Limit the number of charge/discharge cycles. I.e. charge your phone when you have to. The best thing to do would be to only charge it once it's below about 20%, and when you do charge it, charge it all the way up. Unplugging it as soon as it reaches 100% is recommended. 3. Don't leave it at a low % charge for a long time, it's unhealthy for Li-ion batteries. There is no need to "cycle" your battery (you do that with Ni-Cad batteries). Other than that, it's a really nice phone and being samsung's "flag ship," there are a lot of available accessories for it. I am using the Spigen Slim Armor case and really like it. I also would highly recommend a tempered glass screen protector, it has a much better feel than a plastic screen protector. Lastly, I had no issue switching from an iphone 4 to this phone. It took a bit to get used to, but I was quick to realize the many new benefits. The new screen was daunting at first, but my hands are big enough to hold it, and it is a lot easier to use and see.|on January 13, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

1330|Extremely Pleased!! We actually ran weeks after purchase, into the holiday season, due to conflicting issues w/VERIZON WIRELESS, before we could even so much as Remove Them (we bought two) From The Box!  That was really very difficult!  As we went back n forth w/VW, we found it easier to leave the Beautiful Brown Amazon Box, just sit tight in original pking right in plain sight on our table! This simplistic reminder made us MORE likely to FINISH this problem w/or w/o VW!  (esp since we have been w/them for 15yrs (right after 5 yrs w/Cingular - that's a long time customer, but you know how it goes!) **** AMAZON CUSTOMER CARE is the real $#@!  They are "Simply The Best!!"  they called and asked if there was ANYTHING they could do?!  They asked if they could keep cking back occasionally - You bet!  Finally, all worked out w/ VW for time being, and TA~DA!!! We thought we heard music, nah it was the Beautiful Sparkle of My NEW COPPER GOLD SAMSUNG GALAXY S5!!!

This is her first smartphone, and she seems to be learning how to use it fairly quickly. I did the initial set up for her, and I must say in the brief time I was able to handle this phone, I too fell in love with it.

1347|Great price.  Phone works.  I was an existing Verizon customer with a 2+ year old phone.  It was a little pain to activate my new device, probably since not purchased directly from Verizon.  It didn't auto-activate when I turned on the phone, as described in the instructions.  Instead, I first had to call Verizon customer service from a land line to tell them a bunch of numbers from the sticker on the box, such as IMEI code, so that they would recognize my SIM card that was pre-installed on the phone.  Then it activated fine when I turned on the phone.|on January 12, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1351|An outstanding phone. I've been slugging along with various cellphones over the years, and have had two flip phones. Believe me I did my research on these, asking others, comparing,  and researching Consumer Reports. I really didn't want to commit to another two-year-agreement with Verizon, but this phone was FREE (with $50 rebate) at Costco, and it changed my mind. I am not sorry. This phone is everything I could ask for. (Check into the techs and specifics). Totally satisfied/happy. I strongly suggest you get books on it to learn, especially if its your first smartphone. I found the "Dummies" book the best, step by step for me. Compared with simpler phones it is more to learn because it offers MUCH more. Very highly recommended.  The best.|on January 11, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1352|The larger size took some getting used to as my previous phone was a Droid Razr M. One handed operation is very difficult for me but the phone does have a neat feature that you can turn on to reduce the screen size. I adjusted some of the settings to reduce battery usage and have consistently used the phone for up to three days without charging. I use the phone for texting, taking photos/videos, and occasional web browsing. The call quality has been good and signal strength has been adequate. I have no major complaints with the design or functioning of this phone. The camera was one of the main selling points of this phone, though I am not sure why it receives such high praise. The camera works and the pics are okay, for a phone, but are nothing to brag about. This phone is easy to use and I find the software to work just fine. I recommend this phone to anyone.|on January 11, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

I also don't understand why so many people have trouble with the fingerprint scanner. once i registered my print, it worked flawlessly 99% of the time. Normally it was my fault not putting my finger over the scanner correctly. i will say it is a minor upgrade from the Galaxy S4 i previously had, but i have not been disappointed one minute with this phone. A great piece of technology, well worth any price. Thank you Amazon!!|on January 11, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1363|Great deal through Amazon. I'm pretty much stuck with AT&T where I live and travel to, so when my contract ran out and the Samsung S2 phones we had were acting up, I went looking for upgrades. I couldn't find any decent deals through ATT' s own web site so I went to a local store and saw the Fire phone. It was totally awesome but I had some reservations because it was new and had some bad press. I decided to go on Amazon to read more.finally was just about ready to buy two, when I clicked  on something by accident and found new Samsung Galaxy S5  for a little over $40. After happy dance, I went through the process and to my surprise, I could keep my old plan which was cheaper than the new bundles because of low data  allowances .. Most of ours is through wifi so no biggie. This is the phone to get....and buy Amazon for best deals.|on January 10, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

I use  this nearly everyday and I love it. In terms of speed this phone is very fast. Compared to the iPhone 5s I feel that this phone lags far less than  my iPhone did and that it processes my requests faster. In terms or user-friendliness I feel that Samsung has improved greatly as well. Everything is set up on this phone in an orderly manner that makes things easy to find and use which is awesome, especially if you are a first time Android user. Lastly, the amount of customizationa available for this phone is amazing! Users can set their phones to talk to them, use Google as you would Siri for Apple, and customice greetings as well.

1402|I am SO glad I purchased this phone. I had the Samsung Galaxy S3 before making this purchase and the operating system is exactly the same, so there is nothing new to get used to. The screen is slightly bigger which I like when surfing the internet or reading on my phone. I think that this is the perfect size, anything larger than this would seem a little bulky even when storing in my purse. When going out my husband sometimes has me put his phone in my purse- also an S5- because it does not fit comfortably in his pants pocket when sitting down and standing up repetitively. He mentions that although this sometimes can be a slight inconvenience it is worth it to have all of the features and benefits that this phone has to offer. It is LTE capable with sprint, which is awesome. It also has a WI-FI calling feature that we use when at home to get great service. My recommendation would be to thoroughly review all of the features. This phone, in my opinion, is the best phone available on the market right now. I have owned a Samsung Galaxy since the 1st version and I believe that Samsung has stayed ahead of the game in terms of technology. I have never had any issues and this phone, thus far, has proven the same again. I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase and would not change anything about the phone.|on January 7, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1412|Well, my Samsung Galaxy S3 bit the dust the other day so I replaced it with an Galaxy S5. Here is what I have noticed so far: the screen is a bit bigger than the S3, but the phone is not bulky at all. Processing speed seems to be much faster and I love the camera.  Camera focuses fast, which is great for me as I use my phone camera for work and need pictures to turn out right the first time. I also noticed that this phone is not programmed for left-handers. "My Magazine" screen is what comes up if you scroll left from your home screen. I have absolutely no use for "My Magazine," but have not figured out how to delete it or at least move it to another screen. To get to my apps I have to scroll to the right, which is not what I naturally do. In fact, you can't scroll past the "My Magazine" page to the left to get to another screen. You are forced to scroll to the right. (If someone has a solution to this, I would love to hear from you.) UPDATE: Figured this out and removed My Magazine. Now phone screen scrolls both left and right. The fact that the charging plug was different threw me off at first until I read that I can still use a regular USB to charge the phone, but need to use the Samsung charger to transfer data ( you can use it to charge too.)  I am afraid of breaking off the charging cover every time I open it. Hopefully it will last a long time. Other than that, I really do like the phone.|on January 5, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

1424|There are two aspects to any smartphone, the phone itself and the applications you run on the phone. As far as the phone is concerned it is excellent. Fantastic screen, superb performance, great camera and the OS has come a long way since the first Droid days. If these things were the only things to review it would be a 5 star rating from me. However, more important than the phone are the available applications that you can run on the phone. This is where this and ANY other Android phone falls short. It becomes an amazingly frustrating exercise using an Android phone when the applications are total garbage. It's a shame because this aspect of the Android experience is what makes you want to throw the phone on the floor and smash it. Apple may have a restrictive policy when it comes to developing and publishing apps, but I see why Apple has a tighter grip on what apps are approved and published. In the end the phone, whether it be an S5, Droid or an iPhone, will ultimately be rated and reviewed on the application experience and not the phone itself. I have both this S5 and an iPhone and this S5 is in my opinion a better phone. Far better screen, customizable experience, better camera, etc. etc. But it becomes so frustrating using apps on the S5 that I find myself no longer wanting to use it. When applications crash, freeze, or just don't work as they should, you end up blaming the phone and you begin to throw out expletives condemning the phone and not the application. This aspect needs to be improved. If an app is garbage it makes the phone look like garbage and now I find myself wanting to replace it with an iPhone. It's a shame.|on January 5, 2015|2.0 out of 5 stars

1429|Love this phone! Love the long lasting battery, the ease of use, the super easy syncing and bluetooth recognition, the toolbox feature, the beautiful, vivid resolution of the screen, and the 16mp camera. I've never been a fan of stock launchers, and this one was no different. So I quickly installed Apex, which is by far my favorite. It works very smoothly with this phone, I haven't tested the water proof feature yet, so I can't speak to that. But overall, I definitely think this is the best phone I've owned so far!|on January 4, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1430|Very Happy!|on January 4, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars
1431|This is a great phone with one monumentally stupid flaw. Unlike all its predecessors the S5 home button (the one at the bottom of the face of the phone) will activate the screen when it is pressed. This will not be a problem for many people but for anyone who carries the phone in their pocket (or anywhere else that the button might be pressed) this "feature" will cause major headaches. Once the screen has been activated just about anything can happen as the screen is now being "touched" by your pocket (and the warm body part below). Many people have reported multiple calls to 911. Any app might be activated -- the Pandora app on my phone was regularly being activated. This destroys the excellent battery life that this phone has. It can change your settings. I can tell when the phone as been activated and an app started by how warm the phone gets in my pocket. If I had known about this senseless "feature" I would never have bought the phone. There are some kludge workarounds that will help mitigate the problem but none that really eliminate the problem.|on January 4, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars
1432|Ordered the phone because Mom had the 4 and I loved her camera but unfortunately this camera was disappointing. Pictures are grainy. Tried to adjust all modes. Love the S Health app however.  Great motivator to workout|on January 4, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1437|My wife and I own a Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, and now this S5. We love the brand. We've never had any durability issues or any other major issues with any of our phones. That being said, I feel the S5 is a step down from the S4. The operating system on the S5 seems to take up more RAM than the OS on the S4. When no apps are open I have 700MB of RAM running on my S4 as opposed 1.2GB out of 1.8 available GB on the S5. I've tried looking through the phone to disable certain apps but have come to an impasse. Another downgrade from the S4 is disabling background data will cause a warning notification to stay open. It cannot be closed w/o enabling background data. As anyone who has looked at the data usage setting on a S3/S4/S5 knows, background data can really eat up your data allowance (it makes up the majority of the data used on the S5 when 4G is turned on). Overall, I feel my S4 is faster, more streamlined, and less clunky than the S5. Still, the S5 is a great phone. However, when the time comes to upgrade the S4, I will think twice about going with an S6 that will surely be out unless they resolved the issue by adding more RAM.|on January 4, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

1454|This is my first time purchasing Galaxy (or Android) device, and I think this is a very good quality product. Coming from an iOS system, there was somewhat of a learning curve navigating the different features, but after a couple of weeks I now feel comfortable finding the apps and settings I want. From a hardware standpoint I was most impressed by the glass (screen) which appears to be self cleaning! At first I thought I was seeing things, but after telling myself on a few occasions that I was gonna clean a obviously smeared screen, later in the day I pick up the phone and the screen was as clean as ever! The only other thing worth mentioning is while pressing the off button with my thumb, I am careful not adjust the volume whose button is on the opposite side.|on January 3, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

1483|An infrared emitter (control your TV), a heartbeat sensor, a fingerprint scanner, etc.  Seems good so far.  Battery life has been great.  No complaints at all.  Not sure how useful all those different bits of hardware will be but I suppose it's nice to have and they don't get in the way. Update 9 months later...  This phone has odd performance issues.  It lags and stutters quite a bit.  I've tried different launchers and nothing seems to improve the situation.  I powered up my old Nexus 4 and that phone performs much better than the S5.  AT&T updates are ridiculously slow to come out and seem to only add more bloatware that can't be uninstalled.  Very disappointed and will most likely avoid another Samsung phone in the future.  Camera is nice but doesn't come close to making up for all the other problems.|on January 2, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars
1484|Samsung Galaxy S5 is a great phone.  I had a Samsung a few years ago and had multiple software problems.  The S5 has never had any issues.  The camera is great and the phone is exceptional.|on January 2, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

1486|This is great and if you play a newer game or two you don't have to worry about the CPU not keeping up. My biggest problem with Samsung phones is the location of their side buttons.  Without a case it is a nightmare. I'm always pushing a button I don't want and sometimes I don't even know I did it. I bought a Pelican protector and all my button problems went away and it doesn't slide around either.|on January 2, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

1496|Probably my last samsung device.  I like this phone but there is a lot of bloatware and the samsung overlay is a little much.  If you could remove those items with out rooting this phone would be 5 stars.  I also had the Galaxy s3 and really liked that phone but the S5 didn't seem like a drastic change from my old phone. Pros: Camera! the camera is awesome and takes some high quality photos Battery life is really good and has ultra power saving with makes the phone last hours on just 20% of battery life Screen is really sharp and crisp and is nice for watching movies Water resistant nuff said rubberized back, the S3 i had was very slick, but on the s5 the back is very soft and not slick at all easy to replace battery if needed charges quickly IR blaster works great for TV call quality is good on sprints network Cons: the chrome finish around the outside looks cheesy and is already chipping the button on the front will sometimes get pressed while in my pocket and the phone will try to unlock bloatware samsung overlay is to much call/text vibrate is weak speaker is on the back heart rate monitor works but you will only use it once or twice cannot move apps to an SD card (per android not samsung) however 16gb internal is a little low for a flagship phone mine cannot update the PRL which could be a network thing with Sprint. Overall the phone is ok and if I spent $50 instead of $200 i would have given it 4 stars.  We have also have and LG g3 which I think overall is a better value and less bloatware.  The LG G3 is a very nice phone and I would have considered that over this phone. I think my next phone will be a nexus so there is no bloatware or an iPhone 6 since they finally figured out how to make a decent screen size!|on January 1, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

It takes a little getting used to the set up, but that's the case with all phones. My biggest complaint is that it doesn't seem to remember my playlists. Various playlists get deleted for no good reason. It's not that big of a deal, but I wonder: Is this a precursor to something worse?|on December 31, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

Now I am blown away of how much better the GS5 is. I can do anything with this phone. The only issue I had was with the pre-installed apps and advertisements that came with the phone. However, a 5 minute exercise in deleting the stuff fixed it no problem. The data migration from the Iphone 4 was easy as 1-2-3, by using the Smart Switch app. I will be using my phone to fight crime, cure AIDS and fix global warming....yea, its that good. Dont get caught up in the Apple whoopla....Its mind boggling to me that the Iphone 6 finally has a bigger screen and finger print ID, and they boast as if its something cutting edge and new...lol, both are 3 year old technology's that Android has had for a while....welcome to the present Apple, keep playing catch-up..........this phone is the real deal.|on December 30, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1532|I purchased this phone for my brother during the recent black Friday sale. So far he loves it. Very quick stable running phone. We chose this phone due to its ability to be submerged in water, my brother works in a car dealership and frequently dropped his old one while washing cars. So far the water resistance has worked as advertised. The only drawback I can think of is the same drawback as most nice phones like this,the storage, when you have the new nice shiny phone you immediately want to try out as much as you can on it and this tends to fill the storage up quickly. Luckily this can be remedied pretty easily by installing a microsd card into the back. It supports up any card up to 128 GB. So far everything it the phone is working great. Will update if that changes.|on December 29, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
1533|I upgraded from a Droid RAZR Maxx to the GS5 and this phone is just amazing. My old phone was slow, would lag, had poor battery life and was basically stale. The GS5 has a lot more bells and whistles and allows me to easily accomplish tasks in seconds that would take minutes with my old phone. When I enable power saving mode, my battery lasts for three days at work with light to moderate use. With power saving mode off, battery life is somewhat lacking but the phone charges fast and if I really want to conserve battery life, I can enable ultra power saving mode. The phone has a removable battery and you can buy a replacement battery and charger from Amazon for less than $40. Just make sure you purchase the battery and charger from Amazon and not a third party. If you haven't decided on what phone to buy, consider holding out for a few more months. The GS6 will be coming out in the spring. I upgraded my phone and renewed my contract thru Amazon and saved a lot of money. VZW wanted $100 after a $50 mail in rebate plus a $30 upgrade fee. $189 plus tax. I bought it for $49.99 plus tax off of Amazon. BestBuy wanted $199. Update: After having the phone for a few weeks, it fell at work yesterday. It fell about three feet with the Spigen Tough Armor case on it... the screen is cracked and looks horrible. I dropped my Droid Razr Maxx multiple times from 5-6ft over two and a half years and the screen never cracked. To replace just the glass is cheap ($15) but it's not an easy project nor is it a quick repair. To replace the glass and lcd is NOT cheap... well over $150 but it's a lot faster. I'm going to have to deal with the spider web cracked screen for a while. I guess you sacrifice looks and performance for product quality. Even my Droid X was tougher than this.|on December 29, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

1536|I love my phone! However just as a warning that adding McAfee mobile security to the phone conflicted with the security that was already on the phone and when I uninstalled my mobile security it has worked great since.  Easy to use, four out of five family members have it, and this was a great price compared to the store itself and even online. I don't care what color it is since I bought a case for it.|on December 29, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1538|Samsung always has my favorite phones. They are always the most user friendly in my book. I'm grateful for a phone that is waterproof and shock proof. The only problem that I have had with it is the cover for the charging area feel off a few months ago. I really like the new charger, but I think that is the reason that cover fell off, it's just really big and stretches it open. I'm not too worried about it not being waterproof anymore though, because my old Samsungs that weren't water proof were revived multiple times with a bag of rice after being submerged it water. Great buy.|on December 29, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

1541|A good upgrade over S3!!!! Screen size is a little bigger than I wanted but you will definitely get adjusted after a few days of use. Battery charging speed is impressive. Touchwiz takes up almost 8-9 gb of space hence you have only 6-7 GB for your use. Getting an external SD card is recommended.|on December 29, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1545|Buying the phone from Amazon was the easy part! I have 3 phones on my plan and I used the shared upgrade option to early upgrade on my line. I called AT&T beforehand to let them know that's what I wanted to do and the rep left a note on my account. When I received the phone, I called to activate it and the rep who got me at first did not understand what I was saying and she self-confessed that she didn't even check the notes. I had to call back, not using my line I wanted to upgrade and I think I got my same original rep and we were able to complete the line upgrade with no problem. The phone comes with a new sim, they need the numbers from that and also in the back of the phone.  Oh the initial startup wants to connect to your google account, but you gotta connect to your wifi first, so many screens in the beginning just to get to a point to make a call. My rep stayed on the line to make sure the new phone was connected to the network. And then it was all me doing the switch over from my old phone to this one with the app called Smart Switch Mobile installed on both phones. I'm not sure how long it took, I left the phones to do their business and watched a movie. By the time the movie was finished, all my apps, contacts, photos, and stuff had been transferred over and both phones were resting peacefully in sleep mode. As for the phone itself, oh wow, wonderful. So responsive! I came from a Samsung Galaxy S3 which was taking forever to open and close screens and even when I was swype texting it would pause and delay. But this beauty! wow. Some of my coworkers have this phone and it looks so much bigger and bulkier in their hands.. probably because of the cases they are using. To me this phone is a slim upgrade from my old one - a lil taller and a lil wider (as shown in picture). But the colors are crisper, clearer and just the overall responsiveness is much improved. I feel a little bad, my phone case (s-view wireless case and charger) cost more than I paid for this phone. Also, just buy this phone in contract rather than using the next plan. I'd rather pay $40 for the next 24 months ($960) than pay $50 ($25 + installment amount) for the next 20 months ($1000). There are YouTube reviews on this phone that talk about all the features and optimizations you can do. Watch a few of those while you wait for the phone to be delivered and then you'll be ready to take advantage of a modern phone. If you've had other galaxy phones, you already know some of the tips and features. Oh but, the left menu button that was for properties has been replaced with recent apps and long pressing on the home button takes you into S-Voice mode (unless you disable it - please do if you don't use S-Voice). Also S-memo is replaced by S-note (even my old memo notes transferred!) I use the fingerprint scanner to unlock my phone, it can store up to three fingerprints that you can name for easy reference. Make sure you scan your finger in the way you are likely to be holding the phone most often. I've had the phone for about a week and I have trouble sometimes making sure I swipe-scan my finger over the sensor correctly; I'm sure over time I'll be a pro at it. When scanned correctly it does recognize my fingerprint. My biggest surprise was the charging bay door and the extra thick cable for charging. It's a USB 3.0 cable so it does both data transfer and charging. The door though, yikes... trying to open it in low light conditions when I'm tired is frustrating and I am fearful I will break the door. I'm switching to wireless charging instead. The phone can still be charged by a regular micro USB cable connect it to a power adapter; I have tried both the regular micro USB and the super-size USB 3.0 cable connected to a computer and the charging is painfully slow. But this phone has great battery life (compared to my s3), so I really only charge it at night for a few hours and then leave if off charge even over night while I sleep. I'm trying to get my cousin to upgrade her s2 to this phone; for the price this is a wonderful deal on a smartphone that's a market competitor for other top of the line smartphones out there. Yes there is bloat with the Samsung apps, but I think of it as another layer of protection that I can use to back-up my apps and data and find my phone in addition to the AT&T and Google offerings. Good luck, enjoy the phone! Cheers - iShar|on December 29, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1558|This is an absolutely wonderful phone. Water proof as promised, it also has the upshot of having the touch screen work with any metal object. Some might find this annoying, but I enjoy using pin-point objects as my stylus. I wish I could give it 4 and a half stars, as the only thing I don't like about it is it tends to 'nanny' you. I get occasional messages about how high volumes can be bad for headphones users and about security features I don't want. I'm sure there is a way to shut this off, so I'm still loving this phone.|on December 28, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
1559|Works great so far. Haven't run into any problems yet. Fantastic phone. I am not an ubergeek as far as phones go, but it is easy to use.

It really is probably the best phone out there...from the Owening Corning Gorilla Glass III which is smooth and unscratchable to the fast processing and long battery life.

1606|The Galaxy S5 looks nice, so far seems to hold up well, has a good camera and nice view screen. I have had the phone for a few months and have not experienced any technical problems with it. However, I do not like they organization of the phone. It seems very poorly organized compared to the last couple phones I've owned. It is more difficult to navigate screens, find apps, and look at contact info without accidently calling that person, etc. Most of these issues are minor, and more a matter of personal tastes and not necessarily flaws with the phone itself. Pros: screen, camera, weight, power saving mode, finger print lock, phone reception/antenna, Cons: organization of apps and functions, little to easy to accidently dial someone while scrolling through contacts, proprietary charger port Mixed: Battery life is decent unless you want to turn location services on then it drains very quickly. It gets annoying to have to turn it on and off every time I need to look at a map or want the current weather|on December 22, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
1607|Our household now has 2 of these. Since so many reviewers have covered the good, the bad and the ugly on this phone, I won't rehash it all. One thing I hate about this phone, and am not seeing in the reviews,  is the NON-STANDARD charger. Since not having a standard charger can quickly turn into a big hassle, I'm knocking off 2 stars. UPDATE: It is NOT a non-standard charger, the new USB 3.0 micro B cable format had slipped my notice. Still irritating because these are the first devices in the house that use that cable type and we already have enough cables. Now we'll need more. Gotta love "progress"!|on December 22, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars

1620|I wanted to upgrade my phone and had a hard time deceiding on what I wanted to get. But since I was so happy with my previous Samsung Galaxy S3 I thought I might want to try the S5 rather than the iphone6. Well, the phone works o.k. and I was able to sync my data but I discovered a flaw in the display which really annoys me. I saw the christmas lights reflecting on the dark screen while looking at it. The phone was turned off. So I checked it more closely and it looks like a dent in the display which isn't possible. Nothing happened to the phone and it is always kept in a safe place. So I turned it on to see if I can see it when it is on but it looks fine. Just in the off mode I can see the annoying spot under the glass that breaks the light differently in this area rather than just reflecting it. I am really upset about it since we just gotten this device. So boohoo for Samsung, next time I will make a better choice when picking a new phone.|on December 20, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

1622|So far, so good! No problems with the phone, but the earbuds make a lot of noise if you rub the wire on your body while wearing. I really don't care for the "in the ear" bud concept; the old Apple ear speaker works much better, less tiring on the ear to wear, and does not have the noise problem. Makes me wish I had gotten the IPhone with their headset. Or is Samsung selling Beats? You gotta have some other headphone set.|on December 19, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

1626|I love my Galaxy S5.  I've used a broad range of smartphones, and never have I been satisfied or felt anything other than disappointment and aggravation, so I do not say this hastily, the Galaxy S5 is the best smartphone I have ever used, and the best smartphone on the market. First off this PHONE looks amazing.  It's stylish, just the right height, ridiculously slim, and I no longer fear bringing my phone out in a room full of iPhone users. The DISPLAY makes you feel like you have a 42 inch plasma TV in the palm of your hands. It is by far the brightest screen I have ever seen.  Images are vivid, crisp and detailed.  You see things you never knew you didn't want to see. You will quickly delete that all too up and personal selfie you thought looked good in. This phone is the FASTEST phone I have ever used. Boot time is nonexistent, as in the unlikely event you will ever have to actually restart it will only take about five seconds.  Not only boot time but everything is amazingly fast on this phone.  I have never had to wait for this phone to catch-up to my gestures or wait for an app to load.  Even webpages load instantly. BATTERY life is a worry of the past, you will rarely have to worry about finding a power outlet because your battery died.  I use this phone rigorously and the battery has never drained 100%. The few times I got to about 20% I just activated one of the two power saving modes.  Standard power saving mode, which at 20% gives you about an hour of continuous use, and about a day of standby.  Ultra Power save mode, restricts the phone to several applications. I've only had to use this mode once when my battery was at 2% and I just needed to make sure I had enough power to make a phone call when I got off the subway, and sure enough an hour later the phone was still on and I was able to place that call. Fear of the screen cracking is so 2013, this is the most DURABLE phone out there. Cellphone protectors are hideous, I refuse to put one on this phone, so I was very surprised when I accidently threw it on concrete and the screen did not break, crack or chip.  I was even more surprise the next time, and the next.  Now I have dropped it so many times I can't even remember how many, and the screen is still perfectly in place without a scratch.  There are a couple of minor nicks on the body however but there aren't many, especially considering how hard the phone dropped. I could go on, and on about the many features that make the Galaxy S5 the best smartphone on the market.  I haven't even mentioned the FINGERPRINT reader (which could use a little work on its accuracy), or SIDESYNC the desktop app by Samsung which allows you to control your phone from your desktop or Galaxy Tab. It is like remote desktop for your phone. I say again I LOVE MY GALAXY S5!|on December 19, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1652|I will NEVER *EVER* buy another Samsung product. This is the third Galaxy S5 I'm using as the first two were defective and had to be replaced.  It has been an absolute nightmare because even though I backed everything up, restoring the phone is so incredibly difficult and time consuming it has taken all of my will power not to hurl this phone up against the wall.  After several calls to support for getting this 2nd replacement up and running, I'm done with it!  Now the default music app no longer has any of my playlists so I have to make them all over from scratch.  I don't understand, why in 2015, When you upgrade or change phones, it isn't seamless, or at lest the next closest thing.  I should be able to remove my SIM card and my memory card, put it in the new device and then the phone *IF THE SAME MODEL* ought to be able to reinstall every app and setting to the way it was on the old phone.  If I didn't hate Apple so much I'd switch as I hear it's pretty much seamless in transferring everything over from your old phone to your new one.|on December 16, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

1655|This phone screen cracked within 3 weeks of purchase  and it didn't even touch the ground.  Then samsung said the phone was abused. I put the phone in a case and glass screen protector before I used it and still broke. It's a joke.|on December 16, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

1657|Awesome phone! Got here quickly and is amazing!|on December 16, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
1658|Just okay. Let's just say, I wish I got an Iphone! I'll start with the good... 1. The screen is awesome - a bright and beautiful display. 2. Expandable storage - and micro SD cards are really cheap these days 3. In general, more options and freedom as far as apps, controls, music, etc than the Iphone. Then the bad... 1. The Touch wiz interface is very laggy.  Scrolling from screen to screen is super slow. 2. Camera is slow.  It takes way too long to load and by the time it loads, I have missed the moment I wanted to take a picture of. 3. Touch screen almost too sensitive. I find often that before the screen goes back to sleep that I have either called someone or moved some icons around. 4. The auto correct is awful when compared to the iphone in texts and emails. (I understand this could probably be fixed with an app, but don't have time to screw around with it). 5. The phone is almost a little too big for my preference. It's hard to use one handed (and there is a built in feature to make that better, but I don't ever find it useful). 6. The fingerprint reader is useless to me.  You have to do a swiping motion. I find that after washing dishes one night my fingerprint no longer works. I have given up on the fingerprint reader all together. 7. The battery life is just average.  If I don't use the phone all day, am connected to wifi at work, I will come home with about 60% battery at the end of the day.  My husband with the iphone 6 will be at 95%. 8. Google Now is perverse!! lol  I asked it to lookup an address,  and it heard something very, very dirty. 9. I really wanted to like the remote control, but the app that comes with the phone, Smart Remote (Peel), gives me all these notifications about sports and shows that I really do not care about.  It also lost my settings after an update, so I need to reprogram everything again.  I do not want the remote to have the TV Guide features, and bombard me with stuff that doesn't interest me... I just want to control the TV! My Iphone 4s was super slow with the last IOS update, and was constantly out of storage space, so the Galaxy 5s seemed like the smart choice, but I regret my decision.  I have owned the phone for 6 months now and I am counting down the days til my next upgrade!!|on December 16, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

1660|I guess i'm one of the few that really hates this phone.  I honestly think Android phones are not up to par w/ iPhones.  They're getting close, but if you've had the iPhone first and then going to Android, I don't think you'd like it, or at least I didn't.  I didn't pay for this phone, my work did.  I got it so I can try it since I wanted to see how I'd like Android. Here are my gripes or the bugs I experience w/ the S5; - Camera functions lag.  When you think you got a good stable shot, it always turns out slightly blurred or you moved just a bit at the end.  After you finished the shot, everything else freezes for a second, so you can't do anything but wait for a few seconds. - When i'm calling and switching from call to dial numbers, screen always flickers and phone or sensors gets confused.  It's like its caught up in the middle of switching the screen so it won't let you dial any numbers - When I'm calling and using the good ol' leaning the phone against my shoulders so I can use my hands to write or grab stuff, it always hits different keys for some reason.  It switches modes or it ends up hanging up.  Very annoying during a call - Way more ads than iPhone. - Harder to adjust your app settings - Android touch is not as smooth as iOS - Android is not as smooth as iOS period.  For example, if theres a link that opens up a video, half the time, your messing around the screen trying to get the videos to maximize and minimize.  When there are drop down menus, most of the time, half of the menus are displayed and you can't scroll over to see the rest. On the plus side, i like the big screen and the high resolution for videos.|on December 16, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars
1661|I like this phone. It has a vivid and clear screen, takes awesome pictures but is a little big for my taste, it doesn't fit in a pocket. Be careful of background app use on this phone if you have a restricted data plan! Make sure you know how to restrict it or you'll be paying an expensive phone bill.|on December 16, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

1667|Fantastic Phone! Amazon made the upgrade so easy, and a great deal to boot! I love the Samsung line of smart phones and have been very happy so far with the latest S5! The one issue I had at first was an issue with not being able to connect to WiFi if mobile networks was on, essentially the phone would not switch to WiFi automatically if available and I had to actually turn 4G off in order to get the WiFi to connect, meaning I had to remember to turn it back on when I left the WiFi zone.  However this issue seems to have resolved itself, probably from an update very recently and now switches automatically without any input from me, like my S3 did!|on December 15, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1672|This is a great phone, especially now for the price ($50 w/ contract, but has been down to $1). I ordered this one for my wife. My mom and two cousins now have S5's as well. Pros: *The screen is big, bright, and colorful. *The phone performs well and is snappy. *It has a pretty great and feature rich camera, in daylight (see cons)... *Lots of neat gadgets/functions (IR blaster, Heartbeat sensor, fingerprint scanner, NFC). *MicroSD is a must. *IP67 rating is very nice. No need to worry about spilling, getting caught in the rain or being dropped in the sink. *Screen mirroring to the Roku is awesome for sharing pictures or videos with a crowd. *Ultra power saving mode means no more worrying about the phone dying. 10% battery will really hold it for 24 hrs of light use. Cons: *A little big. My wife finds it harder to operate with one hand than desired. *Touchwiz is a pain. Too many hidden options and fixed skins. Nova launcher went on right away. Rooting and romming may be better in the long run... We'll see what Lollipop brings and how much she complains. *It is missing a few features that my Note 4 has (understandably). *The camera struggles in low light. Not unusable with still targets, but takes longer to focus. No OIS, which means videos are wobbly... Totally worth it. She didn't want an expensive phone, but it had to work. This one should outlast her contract, unlike the RAZR she had.|on December 15, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1676|I would say that I am in LOVE with this phone but I have a complaint.... The notifications on the phone go off day & night (app updates, etc).  If I turn the notifications sound off, my text messages sound is turned off also.  They do not have separate sound settings. I even did a live chat with a samsung technician and they told me that it is not possible. But all together, the camera is absolutely amazing!  The phone is so easy to use.  Battery life is okay.  It is a very functional phone and I love it.  I just wish they could change the sound settings!|on December 14, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

1684|Having used the Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy S4, and Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 - I am familiar with the changes made to the user interface between the models. I felt the S3 has the best app menu / home screen interface because it allows me to go forwards and backwards without coming to a complete stop forcing me to go backwards. I believe the change was first made with the S4 and carried over to the S5. I noticed the S5 has a bit more bloatware from Verizon, but many of them can be easily turned off via Application Manager (such as My Magazine). I was also forced to subscribe to Verizon Basic Visual Voice Mail, which didn't work right for the first 24 hours. However, now I feel it is actually pretty good. I still haven't tried HD calling/voice yet, but it is available on the S5 with Verizon. The quad-core processor on the S5 makes the interface feel a lot faster and more fluid than my S3 for obvious reasons. AnTuTu benchmarks showed the S5 rated at 42,412 points which is very high at the time of this review. The battery life is just under 46 hours and 56 minutes with infrequent use, about the same as my S3. The screen on the S5 is larger than the S3's screen and has a higher resolution. However, the end result is that everything just looks larger and sharper. With the Tech Armor ballistic glass (which is a very thick but clear protector), the screen looks absolutely gorgeous even in bright conditions. The WiFi performance is exceptionally good - much better than my S3 or the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition. I am seeing the maximum number of WiFi bars throughout the house whereas my other devices are kind of wishy washy. The camera on the S5 is a great feature. It actually swayed over quite a few of my coworkers who have been die-hard iPhone users. The low light capability is extraordinary without the use of a flash. The HDR feature is also very cool. I'm not a newbie to videography as I have used my S3 for a variety of photography and video projects. The S5 has the ability to record video in 4K/30fps and 1080P/60 fps. I learned from using my GoPro Hero3+ Black Edition that the use of a proper Class 10 micro-SD card is the key to maximizing data bitrate for the videos. The slower microSD cards that are still Class 10 may only be capable of 45-50 MB/s, resulting in the device backing off the bitrate to under 30 Mbps for the video. There's a noticeable loss in quality on the Hero3+ Black Edition when this occurs. I picked up a PNY Class 10 that is rated for 90 MB/s, and found that my S5 records 4k/30 fps at 56 Mbps and 1080P/60 fps at 27 Mbps - which is less than the 48 Mbps I get from the GoPro Hero3+ Black Edition. However, the S5's video quality still blows the GoPro away. The S5 offers some water resistance, but the USB 3.0 port cover gets very annoying. I'm sure that over time the cover will get damaged/broken and the gasket may be damaged as well, reducing the effectiveness of the water resistance. The USB 3.0 port itself is also annoying as USB 3.0 is harder to quickly plug in versus a basic micro USB port. Overall: 5/5 stars, one of the best phones for 2014. I looked hard at the LG G3 and HTC One M8, but the S5 offered the best battery life, fastest performance, and a removeable battery. The LG G3's larger screen was also its downfall as it uses more power and it slows down the phone a bit based on all the benchmarks and reviews I have read. If you already have a S4, the S5 won't be that great of an upgrade. I had the S3 and still felt that I could have used the S3 until the S6 came out, but the Black Friday deals for the S5 were too hard to pass up! The quad-core processor makes a huge difference as well!|on December 13, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1689|The phone is very very fast, doesn't lag at all, and has a one of a kind design. It has all kinds of little features throughout the phone that just makes any other phone look a generation behind. I definitely recommend this to anyone even IPHONE USERS, simply because it resembles it and has an easy mode feature also. Google has outdone them selves with photos and videos that can now be stored through Google and pretty much anything else that you would want to switch from your old phone to your new one, you can now. Kind of like icloud. It's amazing. The next big thing is here!|on December 13, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1694|I can't believe that as bad as the camera on this phone is, it was given such good reviews.  Worst camera I've ever had.  That includes some of the very first point and shoots I owned. The "features" are stupid.  The noise reduction is comical. Most of the other features on the phone are balky and clunky.  I switched from an iPhone 3G to this, and given all the other clunky things about the OS, I'm ready to re-activate the old one. My advice--if you have an iPhone and are thinking of jumping ship, don't do it!  You will look back on the iPhone days as happier times.|on December 12, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

1699|I chose the S5 on AT&T because it has the lowest FCC SAR rating of any smartphone out there.  At this point I've had the phone for a week and a half and I'm still within my return window, so I think I'll be taking it back. Things that I like: SAR - Low SAR rating so it IS the safest smartphones out there. LED - Like the multicolor LED message indicator. Screen - Big screen is nice for web browsing, but see comments below. Battery – I actually don’t spend much time on the phone, mainly use it for email, web browsing, texts, social media, etc. and the battery lasts 3 days. Things that I hate: Build Quality – Very cheap feel compared to any of the iPhones and competing Android smartphones. Keypad - Despite the big screen when responding to email the keyboard takes up so much of the screen that the effective screen size is no bigger than my old iPhone 5 4” screen. Bloatware – Switching from iOs I was prepared for the bloatware, but it is worse than I expected…multiple messaging apps, mail apps, internet apps, etc. that you cannot delete off the phone, you can only “disable” them.  You get all of Googles apps, all of AT&T's apps on top of the Android base OS apps.  Terrible clutter and confusion. Setup – Configuring the phone takes a lot more time than on iOS because many of the features on iOS are built in, whereas Android you have spend a lot of time disabling apps, downloading apps. Browser - Doesn’t open PDF links, you must download and the open with a separate PDF app (which is not included). Text Messages - Have to manually download some text messages which I read has something to do with being on a wifi network? Charging – I thought I used the phone while charging on the 1st charge, but on all subsequent charges using the included Samsung cables, I can’t use the phone while it is charging.  I didn’t think this would be but this is actually a big deal. Size – This is a personal preference but the phone is just too big so with medium sized hands (I’m 5’11”) you can’t access the entire screen with your thumb. Fingerprint Reader – The swipe to read method doesn’t compare to the iPhone 6 where you just place a finger on the home button.  The S5 is VERY finicky so much that I’d never use this.|on December 12, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
1700|This phone is fast.  I didn't know my older mid-tier phone was slow until I got this thing.  Web pages load WAY faster with this phone.  Apps are a tiny bit faster, but web page load times is where I really notice the difference.  The camera is also very good.  It might not be winning website comparison tests for phone cameras, but it does produce very good pictures for an average person who isn't publishing anything.|on December 12, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

1712|The call quality of this phone STINKS.  My friends are constantly telling me I sound muffled, and asking me to repeat myself.  And this was before I even got the protective case for it.  It's great for surfing and social media, but it's horrible for trying to have a conversation, which is kinda the point of having a functional phone.  To have any hope of being understood the first time I say something, I have to hold it horizontally around chin height, then rush it to my ear in the hope of hearing responses.  This is convenient technology?  Really disappointed in the Samsung Galaxy S5.  I think my next phone will be my old flip phone.  Sheesh.  Thanks for reading.|on December 10, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
1713|All was good until I found that the phone would only connect to the Sprint Network when I was at the Sprint office with the tower across the street. They tried to figure it out, but to no avail. I was at the Sprint office 4 times. Also when e-mail came in and I deleted it, it kept coming back, even when I would empty the mailbox.  If I deleted a message 3 times, it was in the trash 3 times. Then phone was replaced. It appears this was just a phone with flaws.|on December 10, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

This was a good price given Verizon wanted $179 for the same phone. This would have been OK but for two problems the first is the phone price dropped to $1 the day after I purchased it and I had to spend an hour convincing Amazon customer service to honor that price- luckily a discussion with a supervisor did the trick. The other problem is that Verizon charges a mysterious "Upgrade Fee" of $35 for what I don't really know. My service was already 4G before buying the phone and after a few calls to Verizon  they still can't explain what exactly is going on- but for some reason they know it is correct ;( One more thing, the upgrade fee is charged for any phone no matter where it is purchased- wife bought an apple phone at a Verizon store and the same junk fee showed up.|on December 9, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

1724|I'm only one week into owning this phone so there may be more I discover as time progresses. First I will say I LOVE the large screen, the option for large font (always a plus if you're visually impaired like me) The camera is wonderful. Takes sharp, beautiful photos. There is an option under security that will allow the phone to be reset to factory default if the pin (to unlock phone) is entered incorrectly 10 times. This is good if you lose the phone, at least you don't have to worry about someone having your private photos and emails, etc. If you're familiar with the Samsung format you will know your way around this phone as it's the same as the S3 and S4 for the most part, just with a few tweaks. Now to grumble about a couple things. Samsung felt the need to put a tiny door over the charging port. Why? Maybe just to make it more difficult to plug and unplug the dang cord, especially in a dim room. The door is thin plastic and at the advice of a Verizon tech support person, I plan to just pull it off as I'm tired of trying to to pop it open with my fingernail. If you use a case--like me--this task is even more aggravating as the case somewhat blocks access to the little door. Also I am not overly impressed with the battery life. Granted I'm a heavy internet user. If you're only talking and texting during the day you should do fine. There are also battery saving options that improve the battery life. That said, keep a spare external battery around just in case.  I applaud Amazon for offering this phone for much cheaper than Verizon and not making you jump through hoops to get a rebate. Who needs to mail in forms and receipts for a gift card when you can just get it cheaper off the bat on Amazon?|on December 9, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

1729|Okay phone it doesn't live up to all the hype. It does the things the phone should do but some of the extra features aren't that great. The phone freezes constantly since the third day i had it. I have to restart it when it does that. I love the fingerprint thing it works great if your a precise person.

1735|I like the phone, but DO NOT get it from amazon. When I took my phone to Verizon to activate it they told me the phone was already activated under another account. Did I just buy a stolen phone? Also this phone has had enormous amounts of glitches that none of my friends with the phone have had. My location and maps never work, it won't download anything off the internet and sometimes the screen freezes and needs the battery taken out to work again. I've had the phone for a few months so amazon won't refund me, but don't waste your time with their refurbished POS. Spend the $50 rebate at your carrier, you won't have so many problems.|on December 7, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

1745|Battery life is amazing on this phone! I love the Power Saving mode as there is lots to configure (black and white color mode saves a lot of battery life). Very nice looking phone, however it is a slightly bigger GS4 in reality, with better features. The charging port is awesome as it is USB v3.0, is backward compatible with the micro-usb and the little panel water-proof seals the charging port (keeping it free from debris and dirt).|on December 6, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1748|This phone is amazing. It runs really smooth and the display is super sharp. Samsung just keeps making amazing phones. Its slim just like any phone now a days, so it fits comfortably in my pocket. There are so many different features on this phone that would benefit anyone. Especially the s health feature, Im not a very active person and even i enjoy using that feature. It makes me want to purchase the galaxy gear to go with it. I love the fact that the phone is water proof so i don't have to worry about accidentally dropping it in water or anything. I always have to try out new phones when they come out and this is by far the best phone out there right now. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a new phone to go with the galaxy s5. It is one of the easiest phones to use.|on December 5, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
1749|UPDATE: So after having this phone for almost a year, I wanted to note a few things I have been having issues with. First off, the camera seems to have trouble focusing properly. I am not a complete photography amateur - I can set up a shot. Even when shooting something one-dimensional/"flat" at an even distance, the camera sometimes has trouble figuring out how to get it in focus. Sometimes it gets it in perfect focus for half a second, then gets confused and keeps adjusting. And heaven forbid a digital camera let the user manually adjust focus. So this has been quite frustrating. Additionally, I just bought a new Honda Civic, which is supposed to have seamless Pandora and Bluetooth functionality. Unfortunately, it's anything but seamless. When I leave and re-enter the vehicle, the phone has trouble playing Pandora. The display in the vehicle shows that Pandora is connected, but it just locks up and does nothing. I have to get my phone out, close all the programs running, and re-start Pandora to get it to play. Then, if I plug the phone into the USB port, it starts MirrorLink and locks the phone. Sadly, MirrorLink doesn't even work at all, and it also means I can't use Google Maps, which is really inconvenient if I need to charge the phone while I'm in an unfamiliar place. I have a friend who also bought a new Civic, but she has an iPhone and never has issues with connectivity to her vehicle. Finally, I don't like how the phone always wants to connect to any available WiFi network without prompt. Even if I turn off the WiFi button in the toolbar, it seems to turn itself back on a short time later. For example, any time I go into a Starbucks, Home Depot, (etc.) it'll connect to their network and then lock up because I have to accept their terms of use to use their network. I have spent a lot of time trying to find a setting that changes this, but it doesn't look like there is one. Also, this poses a huge security risk, because not every network is safe to connect to and so I don't always want to use WiFi in public. Overall, I'm still pretty satisfied, but I'm definitely going to do more research when I buy my next high-end smartphone. ================================================================== So I must admit off the bat that I'm not the biggest phone nerd on the planet by any means. I have only had one "smart" phone before this, and while it was decent I definitely never used it to its full potential. That being said, my experience with this phone so far has been very positive. When I first took it out of the box, I was like "WOW this thing is HUGE!!! What have I gotten myself into?!" but after using it for a few days it feels very comfortable. Even from day one it didn't feel any bigger in my pocket. The screen is bright and the colors are great, and the camera is amazing. I really like playing with the "S Voice" and the "OK Google" features, although I haven't done much more than play around. It came with a lot of applications and other junk that I'll never use, but it wasn't a big deal to delete/disable those kinds of things. I was hoping that the battery life would be an improvement over my previous three-year-old HTC Evo, but it still needs to be charged daily with the amount I use it. Of course there are various power saving modes that disable certain features to prolong battery life. Overall, I am looking forward to taking full advantage of the phone's features, especially in terms of productivity and fitness.|on December 5, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars

1770|I love this phone and buying from Amazon it was a great value and connecting it to your Verizon plan is a snap... also Amazon makes setup a snap. Delivery was really fast. Highly recommend! Only caution is that there is no easy way to transfer your contacts and texts. I had to dig and went to Samsung site to discover there is a program that allows you to backup your existing Samsung phone and transfer to your new phone. These instructions should be included in the package. I'm a bit of a techy and it took me 3 hours to find this information and figure this out while I was stressing out.... I think most would just give up and from what I've heard from others the folks at the Verizon store are no help either.|on December 3, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
1771|Great phone! Similar enough to the previous S4 but a few different features. Great screen size; very clear. This phone takes amazing pictures -- very clear. The heart rate sensor on the back is variable for me; sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn' seem to read. However, I wouldn't worry too much about this as the rest of the phone is great, unless you're only going to be working out with your phone. The battery seems to maintain its charge fairly well, a bit better than previous S4 in my opinion (but it is a larger battery).|on December 3, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
1772|I had a iPhone 4S for 2 years and the 5S for a few months -5 or 6 maybe. At one point the 5s became unbearable: incredibly poor battery life, stupid restrictions on customization, unavoidable steps to reach certain functions that I routinely use, and a definite reduction in  quality (that mushy home button). Went ahead and paid full price for a Galaxy S5. Oh dear, I wish I had started here from the beginning. This phone is better in every way. Faster, better battery, superb battery management, deeply customizable,... now I can do what I want the way I want and not the way Apple thinks I have to do it. The only thing I would add is about design. For some reason that escapes me some people say that this phone looks cheap. I beg to differ. I found  this phone clearly elegant. If you want to know what ugly and kitchs look like have a look at the iPhone 6 (or 6 plus for that matter): that is what I call a joke of design. Having had both the 4S and the iPhone 5S I can say from experience that this phone is leaps and bounds better than Apple's.|on December 2, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
1773|I bought it when it went on sale to replace my S3. Everything with the phone is ok except for the fact that I believe it came with a defective SD card reader. I've tried multiple SD cards and formatted it to NTSF, FAT32, and exFAT. Nothing works. It won't let me format through the phone either since I can't mount it. I googled this and it seems like this is a common problem that Samsung isn't addressing. The SD card is one of the biggest selling points for Android and I'm disappointed that it doesn't work. It also doesn't seem like I can exchange it since I bought it on sale.|on December 2, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

1775|I brought this phone after waiting months after it was released to get it and hands down it is the best Android phone I have dealt with! A few years ago I switched from Android phones to apples iPhone because iphones are such great quality and simple. But when I first seen the Samsung galaxy s5 I knew it would give iPhone a run. I am so glad I made the switch to the Samsung s5! The quality of the phone is all around beautiful! It moves fast and does not freeze or crash! The graphics are beautiful and the sound is crisp and clear (HD). The features are so easy to get use to and very convient. And the camera takes beautiful pictures and video. Honestly I can not put this phone down since I got it. I am in love with the finger print lock option it let's me know my phone is secured and I can also make purchases with my finger tip! Awesome! The battery give a good 9 hours before it hits 30% to 40% battery time left which is awesome compared to most phones. And you can get more time with the powersave mode. I am so happy with my purchase. No regrets as of now.|on December 2, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

The screen is amazing, it's fast, light, and feels nice in the hand.  Did I mention it's water resistant? Super cool. I also like the fact that I can change the battery myself, and it's much cheaper to fix.  The fact that apple makes all of there products nob-user serviceable was really starting to frustrate me; don't they make enough money already? Getting back to the phone, I love the OS, the feel, the look and the functionality.

1791|I agree 100% with the reviewer Kevin Jarboe. I have experienced many of the same issues. Been using Samsung Galaxy S Series for a few years (S, S3, S4 and S5 now). I usually love Samsung phones but I am very disappointed with the S5. It is the worst user experience I have had with this series of phones. I was excited about the S Health App and used it religiously. However, Samsung forced updates often that caused the app not to work anymore or loss of health data I took extra time to record everyday. This happened at least 3x so I finally removed the app. Sad because this was my favorite app and also one of Samsung's selling points. There are way too many taps required to get to the options or page destination you need. Example: While listening to music, I turn up volume, the phone stops 1/2 way up with a notification 'listening to music at a high volume can damage hearing..blah blah' then you must tap continue before the volume will crank up any higher. I don't like to be disrupted when I am enjoying my music. There is no option given to NOT show that message anymore so this happens everytime. Another example: Texting or browsing websites, if you receive a link via text from someone in your contacts, then tap the link to open, a msg displays with about 5 options, then you select, then a warning msg displays, then you tap continue, then the option of what browser to use displays, select and finally your page shows up. WTF!?! That is 4 taps just to view a web page sent from a friend via text. Why not just use my default browser, let the system autoread whether msg is from my contacts and eliminate the question of whether I want to open this link. This should be more user friendly as the previous versions were. Many of my photos are blurry due to camera having issues focusing. I could go on but I think the reviewer I mentioned above nailed it. These issues annoy me so much that I am thinking of switching over to iPhone. Never used one but I would try it due to the bugs and ridiculous changes with the Galaxy S5 at the moment.|on November 27, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

1793|Upgraded to this from galaxy S3, so many improvements. I'm an extreme critique when it comes to everything, and this phone has minimum downsides. First off, I was tired of paying Sprint for phone insurance, because they wouldn't fix my S3 when it was obviously bugged and broken, even though I paid $11/month for a year and a half. That being said, I wanted to save $11 a month which adds up fast. Well luckily this phone is water resistant and known for being very strong. So I took a chance and bought this, never paid for insurance, and never will. Finally engineers had more influence than businessmen. Along with a Spigen case, this phone works perfectly after many big drops, spills, and even swimming with it. This is a big deal for anyone on a budget as you can save a lot by not buying insurance, where you might need it for other phones. Note it's not water proof so don't have it underwater for long periods of time, and take any case off after. As I left mine on, which trapped water underneath case, and phone glitched out for a few days, but returned to normal. The battery life is amazing, better than any phone I've ever seen or used. I know there are a few others recent phones with similar quality battery life, but the extreme power saver mode which I use if I'm near out of battery and don't have charger is extremely useful. Plus with the usb 3.0 charger, it's charges EXTREMELY fast, 20 minutes will get you a substantial charge. This also is nice for transferring pictures/movies to/from phone to computer. As an audiophile, the audio drivers are great and provide amazing sound to my high end earphones. The included equalizer has a simple mode and advanced mode which both work nice. It's nice not to need an additional app for that. Literally the only downside to this phone that I can think of is that the "drop down menu" does not include a mobile data toggle button. Which is extremely retarded of the software developers (May be an operating system flaw). Because along with Wi-Fi and location (gps) it is one of the few buttons I would use. I used a third party app to make a homescreen widget to do this, but why not include it in drop down menu like my old phone? After my S3 which I found a little big for my liking, the S5 which is even bigger doesn't annoy me size wise, it seems just right. If desired you can even shrink the screen for "one-hand" use.

1798|ATTENTION  FUTURE  BUYERS Read this before  buying. I just got this phone  2 days ago and I will  return  it. 1st: this phone is not VOLTE which means you CAN NOT use the data while you  are in a phone call.  That's  because  Sprint use the one antenna  for calls and data, so when you are call someone the data is turn off. 2nd: since I updated  my firmware  to android 4.4.4 my phone is getting  terrible  reception, showing one bar the majority of the time (Lame) . I tested the S5 against my Note 3 and it was mind blowing  the Note 3 was on 4g LTE 80% of the time while  the S5 was in and out of 3g the whole time didn't connect to 4g at all. 3er: The speakers  sounds distorted when you turn the volume  up. Coming  from the S4 to the S5 i feel like  i downgraded. I will keep using  it for 3 more days before o return  it. The reason  why they are  selling  it so cheap is because  they have warehouses  fill with this phone and they have to get rid of them before the new Samsung  Galaxy  comes  out on February. Im really  disappointed  I knew between the S4 and S5 weren't  much  different  but I didn't know I was gonna take a step backwards. I've done my research and found out that At&t and Verizon S5s do support VOLTE. Sprint have the capability to do it but they aren't allowing us to use it. For more info Google Samsung S5 Cnet review. If you want a phone that wont have to worry about for the next two years get the Note 4. The Note 4 have been voted by most phone critics out there the best phone out right now. it has better screen than the S5, better Battery plus it comes with latest Android Lillipop installed. I returned my S5 and got a Note edge.|on November 26, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

1804|Overall, this is just an okay phone. I have been using iphones for the last 6 years and wanted to make a switch due to all the comments I've heard about how great Android was and the Galaxy phones offer more features. However, after purchasing this phone, I decided to return it. Here are my highlights: PROS: - S Health: Works great. The heart rate monitor works most of the time but you have to be still and in a quite area - Fingerprint Scanner: I read a lot of reviews about people knocking the scanner and saying it doesn't work well. I haven't had this issue, it works great - Beautiful HD display - Expandable memory via SD Micro Card - Replaceable Battery - Tethering for Free (if you download the right app) - Customization: This is a big + with Android. Not happy with the keyboard? Change it. Not happy with the layout of your phone? Change it. There's a lot of room to modify and change your phone to make it unique. CONS: - Poor Battery life (it drains 1% of my battery every time I play a 3-4 min clip on youtube). I've read tons of articles on tips and tricks to improve your battery life and nothing has helped. I possibly could have a bad battery. - No visual voicemail: Yes, you can download apps on their Google Play Store that support visual voicemail, however the quality of the visual voicemail is not as good as the iphone - Sound: The speaker on the phone isn't all that clear. Also when you put the phone on speaker, the phone itself feels like it vibrates based because of the sound, it makes the phone feel cheap even though I very much like the design of this phone. Furthermore, call quality is just so-so. Again I felt my old iphone 5 was more clear when making calls - Camera: When used outside, the pictures look good, however, when taking pictures inside the house or low light settings, this camera is very bad. I was shocked to see that the iphone 5 had much better picture quality and color tone. I can't help but make comparisons between the phones I've had in the past few years and this one I recently purchased. The Galaxy may offer 50+ more features than the iphone due to customization, however it appears that things that iphone can do, they do extremely well and is of high quality.|on November 25, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
1805|I've been a long time iPhone user and made the switch this year primarily because I was sick of the battery issues I was having with my iPhone 5 (that Apple conveniently acknowledge right after I switched and well beyond the one year warranty mark) I also have to support Apple gear for my job (I work in IT and have to manage roughly 700 desktops/laptops) So when I say I hate Apple with a passion, it comes with legitiment reasons given their lack of enterprise support and the fact that they make my life so hard. That being said this is a review of an Android. So how could I hate this product more than my Apple product? Easy. This is the dumbest smartphone I've had the stupidity to buy. You want an audio nanny! You got one! I don't ever wear headphones and use this primarily via the aux port in my car to stream radio. The phone WILL NOT remember your previous audio settings and unless you change a setting will give you an annoying warning every single time about listening to music too loud! You want a phone with more apps than you can shake a stick at? Done. Seriously, I've never in my life seen a phone so loaded with so much useless garbage. Why do I need two email clients just so I can check gmail and yahoo? WHYYYYY? Further to the point the required gmail client isn't even fully featured and wont display when you've got new mail. SOOOOO bad. You want a phone that fights you every step of the way and doesn't put anything in places that make sense? Here ya go. I've never had so much trouble trying to find simple settings such as trying to figure out how to adjust push pull options for something like Yahoo mail. I've never had to spend HOURS on google trying to figure out where something is located or how to do a task on a phone. This phone has induced more rage than trying to watch your favorite football team on Sunday on a satellite dish in heavy rain! The funny thing is, all of the Android owners around me were like you've finally switched! How is it? And when I tell them I hate it, and start to list all the reasons why, they are all like oh... yeah... your right about that. !!!! Seriously, I spent over 45 minutes detailing why this phone sucks to my brother in law and he didn't have a single counter, not one! Oh and for all that talk about this being a USB 3 device? LOL. You have to go into airplane mode to even use it and when you do it still isn't near as fast as even a traditional external drive. All that being said, there are two positive things about this phone, One: I don't have to use iTunes to sync files to my phone (flips off Apple). Two: it has an expandable storage which means I can add another 128gb to phone with a micro sd card for cheap compared to buying a phone with huge space and huge markups to boot.

1806|Amazing processor speed. Good battery life. No wonder one of the top brands that dominate android market. Love the size of S5. Suits us well. For elderly, I recommend Note3. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F2SDM00?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B00F2SDM00&linkCode=shr&tag=swiclu-20&linkId=FDCQ6KSP557MVOUV&refRID=04754BBX2BT8DEB8YB50 Cheers!|on November 25, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1808|I am extremely dissapointed in this product i received. I was unable to make or receive phone calls. I took this phone to the verizon store after spending over an hour on the phone with several verizon employee's to do repetitive troubleshooting tactics. after another hour and half at verizon i was told this was not even a "real" s5 and it was a refurbished broken phone. This phone is a piece of s*** and how dare you charge me 400 dollars to deal with this nonsense. I need a phone for emergencies as i have cancer right now.

1815|when using the phone as a speakerphone, which is something I did regularly with my iPhone, the microphone is not sensitive enough to allow the freedom I had with the iPhone, to put the phone down and actually speak to someone, standing a few feet away, and they were able to hear me well. Aside from that issue, which is a moderately important issue for me, the phone is nice and I am getting used to the different operating system..  I could have returned it but decided to keep it for at least one more week and see if I can like it enough to raise my rating from 3 stars to 4.|on November 23, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars

1820|This phone is very flimsy.  It will bend.  My phone is only 35 days old; beyond the return date, and is not functioning.  It has to be replaced.  The insurance policy is poor also.  It carries a deductible and does not cover water and dropping damages. I do not know if it covers theft.  there must be better insurance.  I now am without a phone until a replacement arrives, probably refurbished. At least Apple has a store and you can replace your phone immediately.|on November 22, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

1822|Upgraded to this from Samsung Galaxy II, so I am enjoying this phone very much. Amazon offered it at a $100 lower price then AT&T store, but then Sam's Club had it for even less a few weeks after I bought it.  It's has very clear reception, nice bright display, and an awesome camera and video quality. A few issues I have is the speakerphone reception sounds like I'm in tunnel per listeners and the AT&T Mobile Transfer would not work to copy over contacts and songs, so I had to go to AT&T store where transferred the contacts but said I had reload my songs from my PC so that was inconvenient.  Battery life is pretty good about 2-3 days with the Power Saving Mode on.|on November 21, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1828|Tried this phone out for a day. I currently use the Note 3 and this is definatly a downgrade from the Note 3. The battery life wasn't good and the speaker phone was terrible! The speaker placement on the back side of the phone is the worst position for a speaker on a phone.  The bottom placed speaker on the Note 3 is way clearer.  This is also the same reason I won't buy a Note 4.  Note 4 has no USB 3.0 only 2.0 and they put the speaker on the back! YUK!|on November 20, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
1829|I hated to spend the money on this phone but because Verizon no longer has unlimited data plans I refused upgrade. This phone is awesome it does everything you could ever need to plus more I'm glad I took the plunge and got the galaxy s5.|on November 20, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
1830|So far, so good.  Upgrading from the Galaxy S3 to the S5 is a noticeable difference. The bigger size and options takes a minute to adjust to, but Samsung added some nice touches.  I have only owned it since Oct.8th, so I don't have much to say about performance or issues i've noticed.  The picture quality of the camera is my favorite aspect so far, though it is kind of frustrating when doing a "selfie".  It takes a few tries and taps on the screen to recognize the image and actually snap the picture.|on November 19, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

1857|I was so looking forward to getting this phone; all the reviews were great!  I am so disappointed in it.  For some reason, Samsung changed the port for the power adapter so it required me to purchase a new car charger, extra power cord for my office, etc.  It doesn't hold a charge as long as the reviews say. I have practically everything turned off that sucks energy and still need to plug it into the charger every four or five hours with minimal use.  It turns on easily in my purse, using up valuable battery time if I'm not watchful.  The little plug cover that is supposed to help it be water-resistant came off within two months of my using it (and flipped into a sewer vent, so no hope of recovery).  The camera is so-so as is the speaker.  The resolution is stunning, however; and the microphone (for voice texting/searching) works really well.|on November 13, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

1860|Hi, I was absolutely in love with this phone until the past week. Suddenly I am unable to make or receive any phonecalls. After researching online, I see this is a problem other people have been experiencing. I tried all of the troubleshooting I could find online, and after nothing worked, I took it in to my local Verizon store. They switched out the sim card and tried changing settings to get it to work...no avail. They told me I need to have it replaced, but I can't figure out how to do that since the 30 day return is up. Has anybody else had this problem and if so, how did you fix it?? Thanks!|on November 12, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

Added a 128GB mSD card. What's not to like? I'm sure it'll be "old school" by the time I get around to upgrading this one, but after 6+ months I have nothing but good things to say about this phone. PS. The IR blaster is good for some geeky fun.|on November 11, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
1867|Wow...from an iphone 4S user to this phone.  What a difference!!  Amazon did their magic..shipped the phone and I received it in two days which happens to be on Veterans Day.  They sent me email instructions on how to activate my new phone which worked perfectly.  I was ready for an upgrade from Verizon so everything just fell into place.  If you are not ready for an  upgrade it might be different.  The only obstacle in activating the phone was that Verizon has you call a number and verify information.  If you don't have another phone handy this can be a problem.  I no longer have a land line.  I called my son and had him call the number.  Old phone was supposed to be off. It worked just fine. I was planning to upgrade the iPhone but wasn't sure what to get.  I just returned from a vacation to the East Coast and knew what I wanted!  My kids had Samsungs and they were great.  The battery on my iPhone kept quitting on me after 6 hours.  I couldn't take some pictures that I wanted.  Their phones kept working like energizer bunnies!  I kept looking for places to plug in.  It was really annoying. The picture quality is much better on the Samsung.  My pics on the iPhone were always dark.  The Samsung takes great pics and has settings you can change. If you have already used smartphones, you'll get used to this one fast.  I've only had it about 7 hours and it's easy.  It's bigger than the iPhone 4S but not clumsy.  I've changed settings, downloaded apps, taken pics, upgraded OS and cruised FB.  I still have 66% battery after all that.  My iPhone would have had to be plugged in. The battery and the quality of pics make it for me.  Any phone can call or email.  In all fairness, I did not even look at the iphone6.  Amazon's price on this was too good to pass up.  Verizon wanted $199. I'm very happy with this purchase and with how Amazon has this worked out with Verizon.|on November 11, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
1868|Even though every S5 is physically the same, the Sprint S5 will be different from the other carriers.  Verizon phones are often unlocked, at least in part since the S4 came out. In other words, if you put a T-mobile Sim card or AT&T sim card in a Verizon phone you can make a phone call. However, data speeds will vary. In may area service with others carriers is a little bit stronger than it is on Sprint, but this phone was still great for my son. All S5's are water resistant.  3 feet, 30 mins.  I can be under water really longer than that, but I would not recommend it!  The great thing about Samsung is that you can stop by a best buy on Mon, Thur or Saturday for free classes also!. For those not use to the newer version of Samsung there is also a lot of videos under Samsung Mobile on youtube. However, all the how to for the S5 and Tab Pro (Same button set up) is under SamsungmobileUK not samsung mobile US or sammobile. Oh, I have been all over the US with this phone and it works great. Also the samsung people can do a software update for you in about 10 mins in a best buy store versus waiting an 30 mins to an hour to download an update at home!  The only phone I used that was faster than the S5 was a note 4! Enjoy!|on November 11, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1876|So far, after only 10 days or so, I really like this phone.  It's light and easy to carry, not as big as I thought it would be. I'm not a phone geek.  I mostly use my phone as a phone with an occasional text and to keep tabs on emails I get throughout the day.  The S5 was very intuitive to get started with and to use.  I had no problems importing my contacts or updating/cleaning out out of date items. Everyone seems to rave about the camera so I had higher expectations.  It's fine, but certainly not as good as a real camera.  I'm OK with it and it's easy to use as well. Call quality is good and notifications definitely keep you updated on your messages, calls, update status, etc.  It's easy to either remove or disable a lot of the apps on the phone that I'll never use...like games and sports apps.  I have no use for those and they were easy to remove.  Others can easily be disabled. So, after only a few days I rate this phone very high.  It's the best phone I've ever used...not that that's a ringing endorsement...I used a flip-phone up until a few years ago.  I'd say anyone would be hard-pressed to find something negative about this unless you're really, really picky.|on November 11, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1879|Love, love, love so far. I am not huge into technology, so I honestly haven't used many of the features of this phone yet. I had the S3 before and better than that one - definitely faster internet speed, which is what I primarily use it for (besides general phone calls and texts).|on November 10, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
1880|Great Phone!  Has everything I need, and stuff I don't but someone else will. Got the copper/gold and it also looks great with a clear cover|on November 10, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
1881|So far so good.  I was hoping for more photo features.  Maybe I'm not savvy enough to understand the apps given on the phone but quite a few of the feature on one particular photo editor are grayed out and inaccessible.  I am still getting acquainted to some of the updates on this phone compared to the S3.  Love the picture quality.  So clear!|on November 10, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
1882|I absolutely love my new phone. Even better is the fact that I was able to purchase it for $100 less than all other advertised prices.  Delivery was fast and online setup was easy. AT&T mobile transfer app allowed me to transfer all info from my previous phone to this one very easily.  Overall the upgrade process through Amazon was on point!|on November 10, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1888|Man, I love this phone. I had previously been using an iPhone 5S Gold from Verizon. After many, many, many billing discrepancies I asked what could be done to rectify the problem. They told me that getting a new sim card would help, tried that and it didn't work. I was frustrated. I then saw somebody was selling a like new S5 for a good deal and I offered my iPhone as a trade. They took it and the rest was history. Now I have my new phone and am enjoying it. After my previous issues with the S4, I'm pleased to say Samsung actually has it right this time. They focused on what people critiqued them about, and made this phone IMMENSELY better than anything out there. I've had many cell phones in the past, and mostly have had DROIDS, but have always also had a soft-spot for iPhones, there are a couple of apps that I cannot get on the play store, I could with my iPhone on the App Store. These weren't essential, but were fun word games like Bookworm. I also don't like what apps you can get like Angry Birds, on the S5 they have advertisements thru the whole game. I'm told it's just with Android, and same with the permissions, I understand that different games need to know if a call is in progress in order to start working, but it doesn't need to analyze your call log. It seems as though apps are a bit more intrusive. I don't game all that much, and when I do, it's from my console, so this "con" if you can even call it that doesn't even bother me. I'm just confused because it kinda gives people the edge that their information might not be safe. S4 did this when I installed a different keyboard. But I can't complain. The S-Health app is far more accurate than the health app offered by Apple. The reason being is that this one on the Android lets you input things such as the foods you eat, etc, and is set up to tell you that you burned off a certain amount of those calories. This phone can also take your heart beat per minute and gauge your health and exercise off of that plan. It helps many people stay fit. The camera is by far the best I've had on any phone out there. No cons when it comes to the camera, but it could be better at times at focusing on a moving object. I've heard that the Note 4 is good for still shot focusing, but if it takes pictures with a tiny bit of delay like mine, it's not going to turn out well. Sound quality is awesome. Music and speakerphone are great. Smart Remote is freaking amazing. I've never had a phone that could double as my phone remote, my stereo remote, tell me different channels as a TV guide and also work remotely with my DVR to record shows. iOS has some catching up to do on that part, the only way I can see it working with them is if there is an "APP FOR THAT" BTW, if you are looking for a good case and not wanting to spend big bucks, check out the Spigen Neo Hybrid. I have had this case on my phone since the first day I rec'd it and I cannot be happier with this case. 4G LTE/XLTE data, but you know how fast that is already. Surprisingly good support with my MBP. I've had many phones, but I really like this one. I know I say in previous reviews that I can see myself staying with a certain product or program for a certain amount of time, and then back out and go to something else, but this item I can say that I will stay with.|on November 7, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1893|My previous cellphone (Motorola X) was eligible for upgrade.  I had an S3 for a work phone, so I knew I wanted a Samsung product.  Verizon had some pretty good deals on other cellphone devices, however they wanted $199.99 for upgrade to the S5.  I went to our local corporate office, and they couldn't do much better.  Thankfully, I checked with Amazon and saw they had the S5 for a whopping $79 dollars.  Couldn't believe it!  Ordered the phone on a Friday, delivered the next Tuesday!  Amazon emailed me the instructions for activation with Verizon, which worked flawlessly.  This phone is phenomenal.  OS seems faster, camera and images are amazing.  Call quality seems very clear.  My wife upgraded to same (except in white), and she loves it too.  The construction seems lighter, but tight.  Just overall pleased with the cellphone, Verizon and Amazons great deals.  Highly recommended.|on November 7, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1896|As a droid device, its great, as a phone it sucks. The speakerphone is useless as no one ever hears me. About half the phone calls I make are the other party can't hear/understand me. The reception is terrible, much worse than my previous phone which was the S III. Occasionally Data, GPS or WiFi will stop working until the phone is restarted. If you had it for more than 30 days then Amazon will not help you. Sprint will not help you unless you are paying for insurance, you should not have to insure your phone at $11/month against it breaking. This is what warranty is for. I tried chatting with Samsung, but I gave up, as it was taking 15 minutes for customer service to respond to every line in the chat. Bottom line, if you want a reliable phone for taking look elsewhere.|on November 6, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

1900|I saved $120 versus upgrading through AT&T directly. I was hesitant because I was trying to upgrade a different line on my account than the eligible one, but I just signed up the eligible line. When the phone arrived, I was easily able to transfer the upgrade to the line that needed a new phone. As for the phone, it's beautiful. I had an SIII before this, and it is an obvious improvement. I love everything about the Galaxy line with the exception of no front speaker, but I was willing to trade off to keep my removable battery.|on November 6, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1928|When rating this phone, I'd like to compare the same generation of phones.  I'd consider the HTC One m8, iPhone 6 series and the Motorola X (2014) are the same generation. It is hard to compare the UI features, as I think it is more personal preference than performance base.  However, I do have to note that the home screens are a little over crowed, and features don't have details adjustment/customizing.  For example, the "clock/weather" widget can't adjust to different size ..  I think this a minor issue, not so "refine" ...  I do not prefer that when I flip to the left, Samsung force the "My magazine" or flipboard there.  That's take up valuable space!!  I don't need that for the whole page .  Now I can flip to the left and use that space to organize my apps .. Yes... I do agree that the phone has good screen hardware and above average camera.  However, I cannot see how it can justify its build quality comparing to others, especially at over $650 MSRP .  And that's the main reason I rated 3 stars. One of my biggest dislikes is the plastic / chrome quality.  I use to phone only 3 days, never drop, and usually put in a big semi-empty messenger bag before I can a phone case.  Then, I only put in my pocket with some coins, and walk less than 30 min, and the sliver chrome on the edge already come off!!  WTH?  I expect better than this at $650. Then, the back cover, it really as thin as potato chip,  And it doesn't come with charging back cover?!  Even the Palm Pre Plus come with it back in 2008.  and the back cover was a little thicker too. Overall, I still like the phone, but when comparing to others, it is just average...  the overwhelming PLUS that I won't deny are that it has replaceable battery, easy to access expandable memory.  If other starts to offer that, Samsung may not be my choose. I still have to wait and see how "durable" and "reliable" the phone is.  It means its general manufacturing quality.  HTC phones do have good and impressive hardware and software combination.  However, its battery and "durability" ( how long it last) is a question.  I have other HTC phones, it start dying after 18 mo.  Motorola phones that I had were like rock.  They don't look or perform impressive.  However, they last very long.|on November 1, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars

1933|Overall, I LOVE this phone. It has everything I need and not much I don't. You may wonder then, why only 4 stars? Well, after less than 3 months of ownership, the charging port cover broke off. I went to open it so I could charge it and the cover simply tore away from the phone. It's not a big mishap, but one that should never happen if they want to keep calling this "waterproof" and "dustproof". Very frustrating. I will try and get it fixed and update this review if that's possible.|on October 29, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

1944|What's great about it: The amount of value they pack into this phone is truly incredible What's not so great: Call quality is no worse than other phones, but still needs work; sound output is too low and has one very irksome trait Everything you could want in a cell phone and more is here. The Samsung Galaxy S5 is awe-inspiring. So let's get into it. First, the screen. While I am getting a little annoyed by how large cell phones are getting, I see the need for it. The picture quality is superb! But seen on a smaller screen, the quality would not shine through. I've always hated viewing videos on my cell phone, but the S5 does a great job of making me miss my laptop less. And games are more enjoyable too! Photos are so clear it's mindboggling. No cons here. Discussing the processor and other "brain" components is boring, so suffice it to say that the S5 is very fast and multitasks very well, without being a drain on the battery. Which brings me to... The battery! I've never seen such an impressive battery life. I don't know if they're using a special sort of battery or they've just figured out a way to use power more efficiently (which, without getting into it, they have figured out a way), but I don't care. All I care about is that my phone lasts all day and I'm a fairly heavy user. I must admit though, I'm not a heavy caller and making calls does use a lot of juice. I do use a lot of data however (both WiFi and 4G), and thus far have never run out of power. The camera is phenomenal, albeit cumbersome. There are just too many options for the casual user. If you're a professional photographer or even just a hobbyist, you've got a dedicated device. So if you're taking photos on your phone, you're probably just a regular person trying to capture a moment. In which case, you don't need 7,000 options that you don't know how to use. It's overkill and it's confusing. But, it does take great photos! I won't discuss data. We all have different carriers, so we'll all have different experiences. I use AT&T and for the most part have had no problems, except in underdeveloped parts of town. I will say, however, that the phone switches automatically between your 4G and your WiFi to help use less of your data plan. While that's very cost-efficient, I sometimes find that I'll be in the middle of something and my phone will get hung up waiting on the switch. That being said, there is an option to turn off the automatic switching. So, your choice. Most of you will already know that Samsung uses the Android operating system. Google is to credit or blame for most of what's going on there, and I, for one, like what they're doing, especially when compared to Apple, Microsoft, or even Blackberry. However, each phone maker tweaks Android to fit their vision. Before the S5, I had the HTC One. Let me just say that I am far happier with the S5 in almost every way. (I used to be a big Blackberry fan, but sadly, they're not keeping up.) Another point I won't get too much into is features. As I mentioned earlier, this phone is so feature rich, it's truly incredible. It does everything you're gonna want and it does it well, and it usually far exceeds expectations and the competition. I do have two things I'm not so in love with though. The first is the call quality. As I said, it's no worse than any other phone, but it still needs attention. For instance, with all the technological advances they've made, why do we still have half-duplex instead of full-duplex? (More info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakerphone) The phone call experience is the one time when I feel like I'm back in the 1980s. My second problem with this phone is the sound output. First, it's just not loud enough. I'm not talking about the little speaker on the back. I'm not expecting much from that. I'm referring to the "line out" and bluetooth. I like to use Audible to listen to books while I'm travelling to and from work or when I'm at the gym. When I play Pandora or the songs I have stored, the volume is acceptable at best. But with the audiobooks, it simply cannot be heard. Second, it has a safety feature that you cannot disable. It's supposed to help you protect yourself from going deaf. Thanks. Much obliged. But, I'm not a 4-year-old. If you insist on being a bit of a nanny, at least let me disable your mothering once you've tried to warn me. I would never let those two minor issues dissuade you from buying this phone. The Samsung Galaxy S5 is still, by far, the best phone I've ever owned. I cannot imagine what they could ever do to top it, but I'm sure I'll buy the next iteration when they do achieve a new level of supremacy. This product is...  Replaced my MP3 player  Easy navigation  Replaced my camera  Tough/durable  Good video quality  stylish About me...

It also seems to hold a charge for a long time, it's super fast and has some nice features you won't find on other phones.

1961|I upgraded to this phone on the Verizon Edge plan. The Samsung Galaxy S5 has met all of my expectations. The biggest issue for me with cell phones is battery life and charge time. Does the battery last a reasonably long time and how fast does it charge up? The Galaxy S5 battery has a long life. I haven't needed to charge it daily and it does charge fast. I have yet to have the battery level drop below 50% in a day's moderate use and it charged fully in less than an hour. Another positive for this phone is that the battery can be replaced. If you get a weak battery you can buy a cheap replacement and change it yourself. I find the power saver settings to be beneficial to battery life on this phone. Included in the box were the user's manual and a really nice home charger. This has a double port charger which is something I haven't seen before. The charger was impressive, looks and feels like a durable, high qulaity charger. The Galaxy S5 is one of the easier to navigate phones that I have owned. The manual is helpful, but the layout of this phone makes it easier to get adjusted to without consulting the manual. Browsing the web is another stongpoint on this model. The speed and ease of use is top-notch! Browsing is so easy! Another feature that I really appreciate is the controls below the bottom of the screen. The right side is a back button, the left side brings up a task manager where I can close apps(Chrome browser, email etc..). I have had phones in the past where I had to hunt for the close apps function. Not so with the Galaxy S5. The weather app has been a convenience. For call clarity and signal strength, this phone has been excellent! Everything about this phone has been positive in my experience. I'd buy it again and my Verizon service experience has been dependable as well.|on October 25, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1970|Let me start by saying that I WAS an iPhone user, but I would not waste my time with Apple ever again. Samsung did things right, not perfectly in all ways, but this phone is light years ahead of Apple. For starters, switching over to Android is made dirt simple and quick by using SmartSwitch. All of my music, contacts, notes, etc., was copied over to my S5 quick and easy. Yes, there is some issues with Android Kitkat not permitting third party apps not being able to write to the SD expansion card, but the Samsung "My Files" app makes it easy to get around that limitation without rooting the phone. Many apps can still be stored on the SD card saving device memory. The choices you get and the versatility you get with the Android makes this phone a much better option than buying an iPhone. I recently purchased a usb slave cable which makes let's the S5 use an external keyboard, hard drive, or flash drive with ease and I love the added capacity for file handling. At $100 for a contract phone, why shell out big $$ for a lesser phone with a degraded experience. The coolest smartphone is not the iPhone.|on October 24, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

1980|Love my S5.  One of the most cohesive experiences to date I've had on Samsung/Android products (have/had a Note 8.0, an S2 Skyrocket and have used some of the other tabs they provide).  Still not without its glitches, but it seems they're ever closer to approaching the seemless experience I've had on Apple products.  That may sound like a dig, but its not.  Apple may be seemlesss, but they're also very limiting in my opinion. That said, there is also a bunch of what I'd consider, useless Samsung apps that come with it.  They're easy enough to ignore/disable/uninstall.  It feels like Samsung is trying to build its own version of a lot of the various cloud services that frankly, a lot of other companies do better.  To each there own. I think its definitely worth buying and look forward to seeing what the next generation has to offer as they seem to be making steady progress on competing on equal/better footing to Apple and Google.|on October 22, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

1982|I am moving from an SII with T-Mobile and this is a big improvement. The battery life is uncanny, usually have 50% left at the end of a day of steady use. I work in a basement classroom where I was previously unable to make phone calls or use 4G at all, and now I have no problem (don't know whether to credit Sprint or the phone for that).  I have seen numerous complaints about how long it takes for the camera app to open, especially compared to the LG G3. I went into a phone store and carefully compared--the S5 takes 2 full seconds, and the the G3 takes 1.5 seconds. I prefer having all the setting options and the superior image quality of the S5, so I can live with the .5 second loss. I do notice that the focusing is not always perfect in indoor closeup shots...definitely miss the macro setting from earlier Galaxy models. That's the only complaint so far.|on October 22, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
1983|I had a Samsung Galaxy S3 for 2 years and loved it. When I had the chance to upgrade I was read all the reviews and thought the S5 would be the best choice. I get the phone at BestBuy through Sprint service, paying the full price of the phone through their "Easy Pay" plan, and was at first happy with the speed, the functionality, and the features. Then I try to use the camera. A black spot in every picture. I look and under the camera glass is some particulate. Obviously something from the manufacturer since it's sealed under the glass. I contact Best Buy: Sorry, can't help you since it's been over 14 days. Go to the Sprint store. I go to the Sprint store in the mall: Sorry, can't help you here, you have go the OTHER Sprint store. The next day I go to the other Sprint store: Sorry, it's been 31 days so you have to contact the manufacturer. I contact the manufacturer by phone: We don't do replacements, you have to mail the phone to us at your cost, and we'll fix it and send it back to you. Leaving me without a phone for at least 4 weeks. I'll never get a phone from Sprint or Samsung again.|on October 22, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

1995|Great phone.  Have had no issues with it. Although, I am a little skeptical about the "water proof" part.  The bottom usb charge port doesn't seem like it's that great and is in completely all the way to keep this phone water proof.  However, I do enjoy the customization of the S5 and the battery life seems to be great so far.  Granted, I've only owned the phone a little over a month, I'm finding it's suiting me MUCH better than my Rezound was.|on October 21, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2004|This is the third Galaxy phone I've owned.  The first was a first generation phone (Epic, I think?), followed by the S3, which I loved.  I was a little hesitant to get this one because of it's size, it seemed almost too big for what I wanted. I've now owned it for more than a month, and I love it.  I quickly got used to the increase in size, and it still fits in my pocket just fine.  I really like the thumbprint feature, though occasionally run into the 30 second lock out because the first five swipes don't register. Beyond this, I probably don't use my phone to it's fullest capabilities, to can't comment knowledgably on them all.  The camera is great, and it's much faster than my S3, as expected.  I have encountered no problems with it, and will continue to recommend Samsung phones to my friends. While I'm sure not everyone will agree, I love the Copper Gold color.  It stands out against all of the black phones my friends have!|on October 20, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2010|I was eyeing this phone since it 1st came out. I've had it now for about a month and I had decided it was time to upgrade from my still working Epic 4G(S1) phone. I really like the waterproof feature as I have killed a couple of phones in the past to water damage. My old Epic suffered minor water damage on a few occasions but always seemed to work again in the end. Samsung made a well sturdy phone with a lot of features. This phone is guaranteed to stay working even if you were to drop it in the sink as long as you have the back cover and charging port cover tightly closed. With the quad core cpu I do more now in less time with fewer reboots or lock-ups. Keep in mind it has a fm radio, fingerprint scanner for screen unlocking as well as so many other features as I'm still learning it. There is no paper manual but you can download it from the web. This is also a sim card phone, and if I understand sim phones, this one can be used with any carrier just by swapping the sim card. There is no sdcard installed but it will take a 128gb sdcard, I took the 16gb out of my Epic so I would have the extra space until I am able to get a bigger card. If you used foxfi or pdanet for a hotspot program like I did in my Epic, this phone will only work in Bluetooth and usb modes (wireless tested but no connect) but it will give you 4G-LTE speeds, which is faster than dsl, but about half as fast as cable. Highly recommended for those wishing to upgrade to the best that money can buy. Make sure you pair this with a good case and I recommend a tempered glass type screen protector as well.|on October 20, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2014|PROS: - fast, fast, fas - beautiful screen - it has a small light in the upper left corner which tells me if I have a new text or email... such convenience and saves time! - With Verizon Wireless, the VOICE MAIL icon automatically converts your voice mails to text; you still have the voice mails if you want to listen to them.  The small basic mailbox is free; if you need a bigger mailbox then you'd have to pay. - 4k video recording to take advantage of your 4k tv! - replaceable battery - can buy aftermarket wireless charging - one-hand feature for those with smaller hands or just intall the paid NOVA app. - open/customizable, unlike locked down iPhone - smart stay feature which looks at your eyes to know that you're using the phone and not to go into screen timeout/saver mode - can install Adobe Flash video player (but you have to use Firefox browser) because most websites have flash video - 27 hours talktime - includes earbud headphones - wifi is both 2.7Ghz and 5Ghz - voice recognition is fast and more accurate than my 2-year old Samsung Stratosphere II - expandable memory using cheap MicroSD card up to 128GB. - Pandora syncs very fast via Bluetooth to my car's radio. - Front and rear cameras can work at the same time to create a big photo with a little photo insert - Even though it comes with a microUSB 3.0 cable, I have the option to continue to use all the old microUSB 2.0 cables I have for charging and data transfer (although I prefer to use the freebie Airdroid app for wireless data transfer with my pc). - can print to printers on my network using Hammermill app and Samsung Mobile Print (for Samsung printers) - IR blaster to turn the phone into a remote control for your tv/dvr box. - Blocking Mode app to silence the phone (such as 11pm-6am when I'm asleep) yet allows me to create a custom list of phone numbers so those callers will still ring. - waterproof for 3 feet for 30minutes. CONS: - The included USB 3.0 plug is hard to line up with the phone's jack. But you can either use the older USB 2.0 micro usb cord which is easier to line up or an aftermarket $30 wireless charging receiver and pad. - when speakerphone volume is turned all the way up, it rattles so I have turn the volume down 2 notches.  Better if the speaker were on the front then I wouldn't have to turn the volume up as high. - No iTunes app for Android so you have to use aftermarket apps like SyncTunes and Doubletwist. BOTTOM LINE: The only thing I'm missing is Apple's FaceTime. 3/1/2015: When I open 2 or 3 apps, the phone starts to really heat up.  However this is now fixed when Verizon pushed out Android 5.0 Lollipop upgrade. 4/21/2015: Google released the freebie 'Google Handwriting Input' app which now replaces my virtual keyboard because it is so amazing.|on October 19, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

The price is right in every aspect too. If you want to keep your number, switch the SIM cards... I powered off both phones, removed, the batteries, switched cards, put batteries back, closed, and powered on. It was quite simple with Verizon. I went to Verizon website and everything was correct.

2023|Back in January 2010 I got my first cell phone, a Net10 texting phone. I posted on Facebook that I felt like I was the last person in the USA to get a cell phone. Someone responded to that post, "You were!" By April of 2014 I was feeling like the only person in the USA without a smart phone. Even my dad had upgraded from a flip phone to a smart phone! So I took the plunge and got the then just released Samsung Galaxy S5. Upgrading from a texting phone to this smart phone has been an amazing experience. I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra cost for a smart phone, as I didn't think I would use the "smart" functions that much, but boy was I wrong! I use the phone for a lot of things I hadn't planned on or even thought of. For instance, I go for walks regularly for my morning cardio. Previously I used an old-fashioned watch and a clip-on pedometer to measure my duration and distance, but now I use the exercise timer and pedometer on the S5, and I think it is more accurate than the pedometer. When I am away from my desktop PC, I use the S5 to check Facebook, Twitter, and Google News (my primary new source). I use the Smart Remote ap to turn my  Toshiba 40-Inch LED TV  on and off when the DVR is recording something, as I have the cable remote set to turn both the TV and DVR on and off at the same time. I jot reminders down in the Memo ap and keep appointments in the Calendar ap. I regularly check the weather with the AccuWeather ap. And I am becoming a real camera buff, whereas I rarely took pictures before; but it is so easy with the S5, and I always have it with me, so why not? And once I started downloading aps, that really opened the door for more stuff to use the S5 for. There was a free Bible ap, "You Version," available in the Play Store, so it was the first ap I downloaded. It works great and has many versions available including the NKJV, my favorite Bible version. I then downloaded a couple of Bible trivia aps, so I now use my S5 for reading and studying the Bible. Then in May I got lost in downtown Pittsburgh coming home from visiting my nephew, so I downloaded MapQuest's GPS ap, and that has been working great at keeping me from getting lost again. After I got my  Roku 3500R Streaming Stick (HDMI) , I download the Roku remote ap. That is much easier to use than the Roku remote when tying in data, like my user name and password for the Roku or searching for programs in Amazon's Instant Video. Then I downloaded aps for my favorite sports teams: the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Steelers, and Penn State. So I check schedules, stats, and other info on them on the S5. I downloaded the Weather Channel's ap for another "opinion" on the weather (although I've found AccuWeather to be more accurate). And most recently, I downloaded a "white noise" ap to use if I take a nap during the day (I use a  LectroFan White Noise Machine  at night, as the ap doesn't cancel out noise as much as the LetroFan does). I know this might all be basic stuff to you long-time smart phone users, but for those of us new to this technology, it is truly astonishing. Since this is my first smart phone, I cannot say how it compares to other smart phones. But I can comment on a couple of points I've seen mentioned in reviews of the S5. The first issue is the battery life. With my old texting phone, I only had to charge it up a couple of times a week, but I then I do not make too many phone calls or send very many texts. With the S5, I'm charging it about every other day. But with as many things as I use it for, I don't think that is unreasonable. As long as it lasts a full day, I'd be happy. Second, it is true that you can not multi-task with it. If I were to get a phone call while on my morning walk, I would need to pause the exercise timer to answer it. But no matter, as I'd probably do that anyway. I have had a couple of problems with it. First, a while ago, I was trying to listen to KLove (a Christian radio station) via their Web site on the S5's speaker while checking Facebook. But then for some strange reason, a notice popped up saying headphones had been attached even though I hadn't plugged in headphones, and the speaker stopped working. I messed around with it for a while, but couldn't get the headphones icon off or hear KLove. Pandora was on my phone, so I set up an account and tried it, but still no sound. Then I thought of just plugging in headphones and unplugging them, and the headphones icon disappeared, and the  speaker worked again. Since I now had Pandora set up, I figured I might as well check it out. I was pleased to find it had an even greater variety and amount of Christian music than Rhapsody that I had been using, including much Christian hard rock and even white metal (a.k.a. Christian metal). So I now listen to it on my cell phone, and I switched to Pandora from Rhapsody on my PC. And I even listen to it on my HDTV via my Roku. So that strange occurrence on the S5 proved beneficial. But the second wasn't quite so beneficial. Samsung advertises the S5 as being water resistant. It is NOT. Mine got wet and got ruined. But thank God I had Verizon's phone warranty. So Verizon overnighted me a new phone. But just the main part of the phone; I had to transfer the battery, back cover, and SIM card from the old one (along with my  SanDisk 64GB SD card ). But still, I was thankful for the replacement. I charged it up that night, and activated it the next morning. I had a few snags along the way, but it did automatically restore my contacts from the Cloud, and I had all of my pics on the micro SD card. But it messed up my Caller ID pics, so I needed to manually reset those. I also needed to reset all of my preferences, re-download all of my aps, and reset those. So I had a lot of work to do. I kept my texting phone in a snack Zip bag to keep it from getting wet, but I didn't think I needed to do that with the S5 supposedly being water resistant. And I didn't think the touch screen would work with plastic over it. But I then discovered that a Giant Eagle brand snack zip bag fits very snug on the S5 (with an added border), and the touch screen works just fine. So I have been keeping it in that ever since. It might look a little weird, but it is better than that happening again. The border I am referring to is  Amzer Border Case for Samsung Galaxy S5 . Overall, I am very pleased with my Galaxy S5. I am using it far more than I thought I would, and it does  all that I want it to. But I am only giving it four stars due to the false advertising about it being water resistant.|on October 18, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

The screen is bright, beautiful, and colors are rich! Photos are awesome! Don't pay any attention to the haters! I will never cross over to Apple! If you are looking for a phone that is not too big but will give you high quality photos, videos, and a great online experience, then the S5 will not disappoint you!|on October 16, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2035|IPhone 4s finally became unusable after the latest ios update. I had to carefully consider the new iPhone since we have three iphones, two ipads, a macbook, and apple TV. I did my homework and realized that the iPhone 6 didn't offer anything the Galaxy s5 hadn't already been delivering for months. I was also ready for a bigger screen upgrade than a 4.7, but not ready for a phablet. Amazons deal on the phone was the final nail in the coffin. I've been able to get the phone, case, belt clip, screen protector, three car chargers, spare home charger, and 6' USB cable all for $185. For another $40 i can add 64g of memory on a high speed card. In order to match the package with a new iPhone I'd spend $300, plus another $100 or so on a Lifeproof Case and clip whenever they're available to keep it water resistant. For 64g total, I'd have to add another $100. And I'd still have a screen almost a half inch smaller with no ability to change batteries or memory cards. After only three days of use I'm already feeling comfortable  with this phone. I needed to use my old iPhone today to turn off imessages, and I thought I was going to have to borrow my dad's reading glasses. If you're thinking about making the switch- do it. You won't regret it!|on October 16, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2040|Excellent phone, i Love it!, the screen is amazing, its waterproof capability gives me a great sense of security, the battery lasts way longer even before applying Power Saving and Ultra Power Saving Modes,  it is fast and loaded with features. Too bad Samsung decided to take the camera and get rid of its Night mode (which I had in my S3 and worked really good in low light situations without flash), turning its amazing camera into a daylight-only deal for situations where flash is not allowed, and there is no comparable mode among the download options.|on October 16, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

It would be better to design the connection to be water proof without that door, i. e. make the connections through a waterproof insulation material. Shouldn't be difficult as they did that with the earphone jack. Battery life is impressive compared to the S3 I traded (waiting on a credit).|on October 14, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2060|I finally decided to step out of the dark ages and upgraded from a "dumb phone" to a Verizon Samsung Galaxy S5 "smart phone". I had resisted that move for several years, thinking that my Verizon phone bill would increase by another $40-50 over the $105 which I was already paying for their base plan. Stopping by Verizon to troubleshoot a minor malfunction of my LG dumb phone, I asked how much an upgrade phone would cost me and was shocked to find out that my total phone bill would drop to $60 per month by switching to a smart phone. Wow. No brainer and took the plunge. I am very impressed with this phone. The camera is simply amazing. I took some night shots at an outdoor concert and the image was as if it were still daylight outside. Also took shots of family around a campfire and they came out just as the eye would see them. Not grainy and good detail. My biggest complaint about the camera is the inability to capture images of children moving. They blur. I wish there was a manual "high shutter speed" option to override the auto function. If there is, I have not been able to find it by exploring all of the settings and options. The other negative to the camera that you need to be aware of... is the delay or lag time, from the time you press the "shoot" button, until the image is actually captured. You will miss some precious moments such as the look on a child's face sometimes. I understand though that you can shoot video and then screen capture a specific moment in the video, to accomplish precise photo saves. Haven't learned houw to do that yet. My digital daughters are going to show me.  Other than that, the quality of the photos are better than all of the point and shoot cameras that I have owned over the years, although I never took the plunge for a Nikon or Canon digital SLR. The colors are precise, bright and overall fantastic. I had no idea what I was missing by not having a great camera on my person at all times, in the form of this phone. There are so many features on this phone and options to customize and control what the phone does, that the learning curve is fairly extensive and you will want to sit down and literally click through every level and every pop-up menu to see what can be done with programs, features, and settings. The phone does not come with a manual (only a quick start guide which doesn't tell you much) so be sure you download the extensive PDF manual from Samsung's website and store it on your PC, or laptop. I haven't tried storing it on my phone yet, but might be a good idea for when away from home. There is a fingerprint scanner which can unlock the phone. I tried it at first but found it to be extremely erratic. After it registered my thumb print and index fingerprint, it worked a couple of attempts, but I went back to the phone an hour later and it continually gave me an error message to try again. So I disabled that feature and find it easier to simply swipe the pattern on the 9 dot field. As you obviously know, by reading the product page features, is that this phone is water resistant and you can actually drop it into water (submersed), as long as it is not very deep (in which water pressure starts to have an impact, such as going 4-6 feet deep into a swimming pool). Great piece of mind for potential of dropping into the sink, running through the washing machine by accident, etc. It is officially rated to 1 to 2 feet deep, so I considered buying the LifeProof case which has better water depth protection, but there were an abundance of negative reviews for that case for this phone....which causes severe echo on phone conversations. I did buy the Otterbox Defender which is absolutely fantastic for this phone, for additional shock drop protection, cosmetic protection, and a screen protection which so far has been as scratch resistant as the best selling screen protector, "Invisible Shield", by Zagg (which seems to be the default choice for most purchasers). Subsequently, I discovered that Otterbox has the "Preserver" case which is waterproof, for about 50 bucks more than the Defender. Wish I had known that before. Probably would have bought it instead. But extremely happy with the Defender since I don't plan on taking it deep sea diving or snorkeling. I love the keyboard and am just now learning to swipe with predictive text and have found it to be very accurate and instantaneous. I am a fast touch typist (not hunt and peck) so I find this to be an excellent addition to my speed ability, being able to "type" with a single finger gliding "sloppily" across the keyboard to desired letters along the way. And the keyboard is large enough when you use the phone in landscape orientation, to be very comfortable,  and increasing its accuracy. One minor weakness in my opinion is that the ringtones and alerts are not very loud and I often miss an incoming call if the phone is more than about 10 feet away. The volume level should be much higher on the higher setting. Another irritation was that after I selected my desired "notifications ringtone", I was getting constant sound alerts, every few minutes, when the only time I wanted to be alerted was to inbound text messages and phone calls. It took 3 different Verizon reps, before I got to one that was Samsung knowledgeable, who could troubleshoot and disable notifications which were happening on every email and junk mail, arriving constantly into my gmail account. We discovered that you have to disable notifications in not only gmail (icon) on the phone's "Apps" screen but also realize that you have to do the same within the Android icon for email messages which looks like a piece of yellow notebook paper coming out of an envelope. I thought disabling notifications within gmail on the phone would do it, but the phone was also alerting me because the same messages appear within this App. After getting the phone,  I realized that the 16gb of onboard memory could be chewed up pretty fast with media, such as videos of family, photographs, and my extensive music library, so I searched for high capacity micro SD cards to install in the S5. Although the Sandisk was considered, I noted a number of negative reviews in which their card had flaws which had to be addressed by Sandisk's customer support (which by the way, appeared to be very proactive on Amazon, by addressing each 1 or 2 star review with a request for the reviewer to contact Sandisk support for a resolution to their problem...bravo to them for caring enough to monitor negative reviews). At any rate, there seems to be somewhat universal problems encountered with these higher capacity cards, in older devices, depending upon what file format the Android devices run on (in their software)..i.e. FAT32 vs. exFat (which is on newer devices). Fat32 PC's and mobile devices will not recognize cards above 32gb. Many people running software with FAT32 have been advised to reformat the 32 and 64gb cards in their mobile device so that the device recognizes the card and can then mount it successfully. So, not being a computer geek who understands the technical aspects of all this, I was a little bit hesitant, so I decided that if I have a Samsung S5 phone that the seemingly logical thing to do would be to purchase the Samsung 64gb card instead of the Sandisk. I figured there would most likely be a higher degree of probable compatibility with the phone, being from the same manufacturer. Bottom line is that I inserted the Samsung 64gb Evo card into the S5, and it immediately recognized the card and also gave me a screen pop up indicating that any new pictures taken on the device would automatically default to storage on the card instead of storing on my phone's internal memory, which is exactly what I wanted to do. Then I fired up the camera and shot several pictures and each one showed the little SD card icon in the bottom right of my screen, indicating that the new shots went to the card for storage. Now all I need to do is to figure out how to move the shots I have already taken, from the S5 internal storage to the card. As a footnote, SD and microSD cards, and flash drives can definitely corrupt at a future date, because I have had it happen to me on 2 Sandisk flash drives, losing everything I had stored on them, so I highly recommend that you use Google+ for backup storage of media. It does not cost any extra and your device will send your media to Google for backup, automatically whenever you are powered up. Also be sure to go into Settings on your device and select the option to backup to Google, only when you are connected to WiFi (such as at home), so that the backup action does not eat into your data plan. I found out the hard way that backing up by "through the air"  internet connection on my phone, without being connected to the internet by WiFi) quickly used (added) an initial 1.5 gig of data, for just 2 short videos and about 20 photos shot during the first weekend I had the phone, which backed up automatically, in the absence of "backup only when connected to WiFi". Hopefully this 64gb card will not corrupt in the future. Time will tell. All in all, I am extremely pleased with this excellent phone from Samsung. Besides that, I do not have to endure any more teasing and complaining from my 5 daughters, about me being in the dark ages with my old LG slider phone. I could never make out photos that they would text to me and I certainly could not watch videos they would post on Glide or other video sharing apps. They think I just became 20 years younger.

2062|Any Sprint Spark device like this (or the Note 4, etc.) does not allow voice calls and data at the same time (ie. you can not use navagation, surf the net, etc. when you are talking on the phone). Sprint should be ashamed for releasing something so poorly planned. I switched from AT&T with my old Samsung Galaxy S (before they even had a number following it) which worked with voice and data at the same surprise.  Imagine my surprise when I "upgraded" to the S5 and changed to Sprint.  I had the newest and "best" phone available, but I couldn't talk and surf (UNLESS I WAS ON WIFI!!!!!!!).  After discovering this problem and the fact that it probably won't be fixed for a couple of years, I cancelled while within my grace period and went back to AT&T... Absolutely disgraceful and deceiving on Sprint's part.  Why couldn't they give the customer this disclaimer up front??????|on October 13, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2068|Finger Scanner works only every 5th time, battery lasts for 1/2 a day max on moderate use, the camera opens after 10 seconds, video freezes for a minute or longer... I could go on and on. It's just sooooo slow! I recently picked up my kid's old iPhone 4 and was shocked at how fast it was in comparison to the galaxy. What I do like: - Less restrictions than iPhone - Android has better apps Is it worth freezing all the time or the slowness? Absolutely NOT! Do not buy!!!! Update January 2015: I had this phone less than 7 months. It was unusable, just as was my husband's S5. I considered the possibility that iPhones are just faster in general, but wanted to give Android another chance. I purchased the Sony Xperia Z3 and it is amazing. It is just as fast as my kid's new iPhone 6. I do not understand the hype about the Galaxy S5.|on October 12, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

This phone is fast, period! I haven't had any issues with crashing or any of the other problems they were having including the battery lasting, it's like they're talking about a totally different phone. The OS runs smooth and multitasking is always easy, this is the phone for people who know phones and like to be able to do more than just talk on their phone.

2081|I wanted a phone with new technology and would work with Straight Talk. I just plugged in the SIM card and searched Google for the Internet settings. It was that easy. Now I have a 4G LTE phone with a cheap phone/data plan. The phone has all the gimmicky features you could ever want. I disable most of these for the sake of battery life. I use wifi, bluetooth and location enabled. I use various chemistry apps for calculations and a stop watch to time experiments. I get a full day (8-5) on a charge. Also buying full version apps saves battery life because of the constant server queries  to display ads that support free apps. Another reason for buying this phone is the guarantee of getting the new version of android. Don't forget your Antivirus.

2084|I upgraded to the S5 from an S3 and miss the S3!  It appears that the S5 has network issues that Sprint "may" be working on.  Where I had half to full bars on the S3, I now frequently have none.  I did some online research and found that this is not an uncommon problem.  I did find one post on a tech blog that had a suggestion from Sprint Customer Care regarding changing the Network Connection.  That appeared to have had some positive impact initially, but one to two bars is still the norm.  Aside from this issue, the phone is great!  Navigation is very intuitive and the larger screen is wonderful.  Hopefully Sprint can resolve the issue with the network.  After all, it is a phone and if you can't make / receive a call .........|on October 11, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars

2090|It's a powerful phone with good battery life.  But it's better with a few accessories. At first, I wondered about the design choice of having a ridge protruding at the edges of the phone above the touchscreen surface.  The home button also sticks up a little.  But after I put a tempered-glass screen protector on it, it made a lot more sense.  Everything becomes flush.  I think it was designed to be used with a screen protector.  They probably realized most people were going to put one on anyway. This phone has a removable battery - and a removable back to go along with that.  You can replace the original cover with a special Qi charging cover Samsung makes for it to enable wireless charging.  That eliminates the need to mess with the USB port cover.  Add in a couple wireless charging mats - the larger white ones Samsung made for the S4 are generally reviewed as the better ones - and anytime you want to top off your phone you can just set it on a mat.  Note that if you want to use a case with the wireless charging cover, it has to be a special case designed for that - the wireless charging cover is slightly thicker than the default cover. Speaking of cases, I actually like the hand-feel of this phone better with a case.  Tudia makes a nice TPU case that's compatible with the wireless charging cover, and you don't have to take the case off to charge.  A case makes the phone thicker, but that thickness actually makes a phone of this size easier to hold for one-handed use - and helps to keep the bottom of your thumb from activating the back button inadvertently.|on October 9, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2095|Note: I have used by S5 for approximately four months at the time of this review. Pros: Relatively responsive, good hardware, good battery Cons: Too much bloatware, overrated camera, connecting charger is weirdly difficult, 16GB goes fast (especially with the bloatware, unless you root your phone and remove...and yeah, I know you can add SD cards, but still), a lot of the gimmicky features don't work well Summary: So Samsung, for better or worse, has sort of a declining reputation despite selling a whole lot of phones. I think a lot of it has to do with their odd relationship with Google, and more specifically the Android operating system. It is no secret that they are trying to move away from Android, which is quite clear (sometimes painfully) with the Galaxy S5. Sure, it is Android. But along with that comes a lot of Samsung bloatware apps that the vast majority of people would rather not have on their phones. And unfortunately these apps take up a lot of precious space on this 16GB phone. This phone is fairly snappy in terms of performance, although I haven't tried other contemporary flagship phones (e.g. HTC One, Moto X+1, iPhone 6). What kind of surprised me is the poor camera quality, especially since reviewers seemed to sing its praises online. Let's just say that the iPhone 6 takes far superior pictures (and I hate to admit this, as a loyal Android customer). If I could have a do-over, I probably would have bought the Moto X+1 (although it wasn't released at the time I got my phone). Basically something with stock Android.|on October 8, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2123|The Samsung Galaxy S5 performs very well, and it has everything you need for it to become a fixture in nearly every aspect of your life. But, like a candidate running for reelection, the GS5 gets where it is today based on experience and wisdom, not on flashy features or massive innovation. With the exception of a few nonessential hardware and software additions -- like the fingerprint scanner and novel heart-rate monitor -- and a few design tweaks, you're pretty much looking at the same phone Samsung released in 2013. The S5 is more of a Galaxy S4 Plus than it is a slam-the-brakes, next-generation device; it makes everything just a little smoother and faster. The S5 absolutely is a premium, fast phone that is useful every day. Its improvements over the Galaxy S4 are small, but they add up to a smoother experience. The phone's high-quality camera won't let you down, there are plenty of features to keep you occupied, and the display is bright and beautiful. And even though it is plastic, the water-resistant seals are an extra perk if you often head to the pool, hot tub, or beach. If those things matter to you, or if you've always been a Galaxy phone fan, then by all means grab the Galaxy S5. And of course, if you've ordered a Gear Fit, Gear 2, or Gear 2 Neo, or you already own the original Galaxy Gear smartwatch, it's a no-brainer; it's one of the select Samsung phones that will work with these wearables. I like the phone and would only look elsewhere if you like metal covering your smartphone, if you don't need every feature under the sun, or if you prefer a cleaner version of Android. Also move along if you're on a budget -- in some regions, the Galaxy S5 costs significantly more than other premium handsets.|on October 3, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2128|This phone is pretty sweet.. i switched from a s3 and fell in love with it.  Problem is the Sprint network.  You CANNOT use the phone (voice) with data (internet) at the same time.  What does this mean?  If you are using the GPS and you get a call the GPS will drop.  IF you are on the phone and need to look at an email, you cant.  If you want to look up something on the internet  while talking on the phone you cant.  This is finally the straw that broke this camels back.. I purchased this phone through best buy and then three days later took it back to BB and returned it.  I have left Sprint and went to Verizon where you CAN talk and surf at the same time.  Sprints says they will have this feature once they update to the Spark network but that it will take a while to reach all areas.. much like it did for 4g I have been with sprint for over 10 years now and they are always behind.  I will miss unlimited data but I still have 2gigs to play with unlimited text unlimited talk at about the same price as before.|on October 2, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2132|This telephone is blocked, doesn't accept any SIM card. I don't know what I can do with this s***! I can't get it unlocked and NO one can help me. I'm disappointed about it!!! They block my phone because they want! I can't believe this! $700 to the trash If you want to use it outside US (with your own SIM card), you have to subscribe for a Sprint account and use at least 90 days with the sprint SIM card. Otherwise they do not unlock the phone for other SIM cards.|on October 1, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars
2133|Excellent phone,  very fast, rarely laggy, has an easy interface, and very cool features. The only issue I've had is a laughably bad fingerprint scanner, it's a shame they didn't wait to introduce it when they had refined it more. Other than that though the quad core CPU and 2gb of ram along with the seamless Kitkat Interface make a beast of a phone.  Highly recommended|on October 1, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2134|This phone may not support your iDrive. Both Bluetooth and USB will keep resetting connection after approximately 2mins and there is no way to get it back working unless you reconnect phone. I spent few hours reading forums and blogs about this issue and to my surprise even Lexus owners experience same issue. This has something to do with Mass Storage Device compatibility that current KitKat OS does not support. (Do your own research before you buy it and make sure you have an option to return it in case if you have the same issue.) After two days of unsuccessful attempts to make it work properly I ended up returning it. Real shame. Always wanted to have an Android and this happens!

2140|I have ordered two Samsung Galaxy S5s from Amazon and am convinced that they are selling refurbished or faulty phones without indicating.  Both of the phones would mute me randomly on calls, even while sitting in the same place- my husband did not have any issues with his Best Buy purchased S5 while on calls in the same place, on the exact same phone plan. My phone locks up and will not work for maybe 10 minutes each day, often while I'm using the GPS and trying to navigate somewhere.  I couldn't be more disappointed with Amazon's cell phone seller and know that it isn't just the Samsung S5 since my husbands phone has worked flawlessly and he purchased his 2 months earlier and runs more apps.|on October 1, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2147|I feel a bit silly loving a phone this much, but it's so rad! The device itself is pretty huge (I previously had a HTC Vivid), but my hands are kinda big for a chick anyway. So many ingenious features (I really like one-hand mode for games) & the added peace of mind that it won't be ruined by an accidental encounter with a glass of water (happened to me several phones ago in a post-wisdom tooth extraction vicodin haze). Unrelated to the device, but I'm also appreciative that Amazon sells certified like-new phones, because the AT&T website kept cancelling my order (after I received an order confirmation) & customer service was mystified as to what the problem is. Being able to save that $100 over a brand-new device + contract was a pretty big influence on why I'd chosen this device over other Androids.|on September 30, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2148|I like it. Good stuff.|on September 30, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2149|This is my first smartphone, and I am very pleased with it. The screen and the phone are somewhat larger than most smartphones, so carrying it on my belt is taking a bit of getting use to it; however I love its capabilities, and the electronics and software seem to be very stable. The camera does a nice job. I have had very little problem with the fingerprint scanner locking feature, except when my finger is wet, and then I can just enter the alternative password. With a dry finger I can unlock the phone probably 80% of the time on the first try. After an initial failure I can almost always get the phone unlocked using additional attempts at the finger scan. I like the fact that I can add memory to it, up to 128 GBytes. Being that it is an Android phone, there is a large variety of apps available. My favorite is Google Maps (comes preloaded). It is turn-by-turn navigation which also shows real-time traffic information. That is a real time-saver. Another reason I chose this smartphone is that it was designed to be water-resistant, as I spend a good amount of time on and around water.|on September 30, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2151|What's great about it: The amount of value they pack into this phone is truly incredible What's not so great: Call quality is no worse than other phones, but still needs work; sound output is too low and has one very irksome trait Everything you could want in a cell phone and more is here. The Samsung Galaxy S5 is awe-inspiring. So let's get into it. First, the screen. While I am getting a little annoyed by how large cell phones are getting, I see the need for it. The picture quality is superb! But seen on a smaller screen, the quality would not shine through. I've always hated viewing videos on my cell phone, but the S5 does a great job of making me miss my laptop less. And games are more enjoyable too! Photos are so clear it's mindboggling. No cons here. Discussing the processor and other "brain" components is boring, so suffice it to say that the S5 is very fast and multitasks very well, without being a drain on the battery. Which brings me to... The battery! I've never seen such an impressive battery life. I don't know if they're using a special sort of battery or they've just figured out a way to use power more efficiently (which, without getting into it, they have figured out a way), but I don't care. All I care about is that my phone lasts all day and I'm a fairly heavy user. I must admit though, I'm not a heavy caller and making calls does use a lot of juice. I do use a lot of data however (both WiFi and 4G), and thus far have never run out of power. The camera is phenomenal, albeit cumbersome. There are just too many options for the casual user. If you're a professional photographer or even just a hobbyist, you've got a dedicated device. So if you're taking photos on your phone, you're probably just a regular person trying to capture a moment. In which case, you don't need 7,000 options that you don't know how to use. It's overkill and it's confusing. But, it does take great photos! I won't discuss data. We all have different carriers, so we'll all have different experiences. I use AT&T and for the most part have had no problems, except in underdeveloped parts of town. I will say, however, that the phone switches automatically between your 4G and your WiFi to help use less of your data plan. While that's very cost-efficient, I sometimes find that I'll be in the middle of something and my phone will get hung up waiting on the switch. That being said, there is an option to turn off the automatic switching. So, your choice. Most of you will already know that Samsung uses the Android operating system. Google is to credit or blame for most of what's going on there, and I, for one, like what they're doing, especially when compared to Apple, Microsoft, or even Blackberry. However, each phone maker tweaks Android to fit their vision. Before the S5, I had the HTC One. Let me just say that I am far happier with the S5 in almost every way. (I used to be a big Blackberry fan, but sadly, they're not keeping up.) Another point I won't get too much into is features. As I mentioned earlier, this phone is so feature rich, it's truly incredible. It does everything you're gonna want and it does it well, and it usually far exceeds expectations and the competition. I do have two things I'm not so in love with though. The first is the call quality. As I said, it's no worse than any other phone, but it still needs attention. For instance, with all the technological advances they've made, why do we still have half-duplex instead of full-duplex? (More info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakerphone) The phone call experience is the one time when I feel like I'm back in the 1980s. My second problem with this phone is the sound output. First, it's just not loud enough. I'm not talking about the little speaker on the back. I'm not expecting much from that. I'm referring to the "line out" and bluetooth. I like to use Audible to listen to books while I'm travelling to and from work or when I'm at the gym. When I play Pandora or the songs I have stored, the volume is acceptable at best. But with the audiobooks, it simply cannot be heard. Second, it has a safety feature that you cannot disable. It's supposed to help you protect yourself from going deaf. Thanks. Much obliged. But, I'm not a 4-year-old. If you insist on being a bit of a nanny, at least let me disable your mothering once you've tried to warn me. I would never let those two minor issues dissuade you from buying this phone. The Samsung Galaxy S5 is still, by far, the best phone I've ever owned. I cannot imagine what they could ever do to top it, but I'm sure I'll buy the next iteration when they do achieve a new level of supremacy. This product is...  Replaced my MP3 player   Easy navigation   Replaced my camera   Tough/durable   Good video quality   stylish About me...

Battery life is good (I'm not a heavy phone user but I think it would be decent even if I was). Feels solid. Charges quickly. Screen is crisp and looks great. The only two negatives: For some with small hands this may not be the ideal phone. I mean, it's not a huge phone and not unmanageable -- and I am happy with it -- just saying that if I were advising a friend I'd say to at least think about the "mini" version of this. The predictive word choice drove me crazy with how bad it was and how it corrected me. I've turned it off for now. Probably need to find a better keyboard app for my tastes / style.|on September 28, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2163|Like other that had posted on here, the phone was great when it was working, then all the sensors stopped working. I have the phone approximately a month and a week when it has problems. I called Samsung, they had me doing couple test, but problems was not fixed so they told me to take the phone to BESTBUY where there is a samsung tech available to run some diagnosis, tech confirmed that it was manufacture defect after he flashed the ROM to orginal factory setting. He was going to swap the phone thinking that I bought it from BESTBUY, but when he found out the phone was purchased from AMAZON, he told me that I need to contact AMAZON. I had a chat session, a phone session and an email telling me that " Sorry it may be disappointed for me to hear but you just need to contact Samsung" . Sprint and Bestbuy will replace the phones for their customer but Amazon can't match that customer service level.|on September 27, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2171|Overall great phone.  I went from a Motorola Droid Maxx to the S5.  Battery life on both phones are exceptional.  I can often go two to three days on a charge.  I miss the Smart Actions from Motorola.  Most have been replaced by adding the app Llama.  Call quality is excellent.  Processor speed is excellent.  Overall an excellent phone.|on September 26, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2172|Let me start off by saying the S5 is a great phone! The performance is second to none, the screen is full HD and exceptionally vivid. You can spend more on a phone but you won't get more bang for you buck than with an S5. After using a the original Droid RAZR for two years, it was safe to say I was looking for an upgrade in the battery department. With S5 unlike other phones in addition to a big battery, you get one that can be replaced! This became an issue with my RAZR as I use my phone more than any other device I own (Windows laptop, Windows tablet, and Android tablet). Having the option after one year of heavy use to replace the battery will be a refreshing change. They always say the best camera is the one you have with you. Actually compared to several 100 dollar point and shoots the S5 is just a better camera altogether. If you own an S5 and are shopping for a standard non-enthusiast grade digital camera... Save your money and use the S5. As an amateur photographer with DSLR's and an enthusiast grade large sensor compact with manual control that is saying something. I have yet to take an image and send it to a photo printer but from looking at them on HD screens I am super impressed. Focusing is fast and low light photos turn out unexpectedly good. This is a camera phone not a APC-S sensor DSLR. The performance for streaming videos and using Slacker is impressive. I guess 2 gigs of ram and quadcore power never hurt! I am not a big app user but do surf the Web a lot and use news/business apps the S5 never disappoints. Build quality, yes the S5 is still plastic but it never manages to feel cheap. The back cover is comfy in your hand and silver bezel look nice all in all a well put together phone. Think Honda Accord/Toyota Camry when I comes to build quality and you will get the idea. I would be re miss if I didn't address the 800 pound gorilla in the room the new iPhone 6 4.7 inch model. The iPhone may cost more but still can't match the balance of impressive specs and performance of the S5. This won't change the mind of hard core Apple fans but considering the end S5 has been out for four months it makes it all the more impressive.|on September 25, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2173|Very happy with this phone.  Battery life is great, the water-resistant quality is fantastic.  (My friend bricked their iPhone by dropping it in a lake by mistake, my phone survived the same drop unscathed.)

2175|I like the phone, it's fast and takes great pictures plus there is so much you can do MOST of the gimmicks are legit. I had a tough time deciding which one to get between this one and the LG G3. I got this one because of the water, dust resistance, and the 16 mega pixel camera. But with only 16gb of storage you would think that's fairly enough coming from an iPhone 4 with only 8gb, until you see all the bloatware the phone comes with... its ridiculous. yes you can get an sd card but.. I seriously have 6gb left in my internal storage bcuz of miscellaneous files and who knows what else. neither Samsung nor Verizon was able to help me out with this problem. I hope they fix it soon, bcuz it does drain your battery. I was able to find some ways to increase my battery life, but the phone shouldn't have came with all those preloaded apps. Maybe there is a way around this because if not Samsung you have disappointed me. I did try to uninstall and disable them but they kept updating and coming back, for the most part right now some are turned off. It says I have 2.17gb of apps, I DO NOT!!! it's disappointing... because it is a great phone. I hope some of you find this useful. :)|on September 25, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2176|The phone is not too big, not too small. The screen display is the perfect size for my use, and the functions are intuitive. The cameras are high quality, and I dropped it a couple of times on hard floor, with no damage to my phone (my case isn't a protective cover). I did put a screen protector to prevent scratches, but the other side is not metal, so it's very scratch resistant. No lags so far, and it's been about four months since I upgraded. The battery lasts a lot longer than the previous models, too, which is the biggest plus for me.|on September 25, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2182|Great phone.  the only issue I have is the bluetooth voice recognition does not work well with my Dodge Caravan. Example, when I say "call home", the phone will dial the number then ring twice and hang up.  Incoming calls are never an issue.  I have read about a lot of people having the same issue. I have found a way around it that works.  Simply use s-Voice and that will allow you to make calls, the only problem is you need to turn  you radio down so the phone does not hear all the background noise.  I wish Samsung would just fix the problem with a firmware update but that is most likely not going to happen anytime soon. Other than that, great phone.|on September 25, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

I called amazon to return the phone. Amazon sent me an another phone with 1 day delivery !!! Unluckily this phone also have the same issue.

2191|Amazing deal. Great phone. I've recommended ordering it from Amazon to many of my friends and family that use Sprint. Ordering through Amazon: Worked seamlessly through my existing Sprint account. It sucked up one of my upgrades from our plan, and I got a disgustingly good deal on the newest generation of phone. A big thank you Amazon for being awesome and offering us such a good deal. The phone itself: Overall: It does all the normal 'phoney' things. So that's nice. Size: It is big, which makes it slightly cumbersome to handle with one hand. But for me, the extra screen size is worth it. Signal: For some reason my signal bar is typically lingering at 1 or 2 bars. This would normally concern me and make me give the "signal strength" a bad review. But wherever I go, I can still access the web/data and make phone calls like normal. So that's strange and seemingly concerning, but it doesn't end up effecting me... so I'm a little torn on that one. Features I actually use: *I use the finger print scanner to unlock my phone. So great! *I put a message on the lock screen that has a note with my friends phone number on it. Now if someone finds my lost phone, they'll have a way to return it to me. *I organize all my apps into folders from the home page. And put those fancy stock ticker widgets and weather widgets on the second page. *All the standard smart phone stuff, phone calls, pictures, texting, taking pictures, making videos. *I actually edited a video earlier with an app in there. Someone in the background called someone else fat during the video, so before I could upload it to facebook I had to crop out that section of the video, then merge two videos together. It processed all that pretty well and wasn't painfully laggy.|on September 23, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2192|I really liked my s4 but due to unfortunate events, we parted (it went for a swim and never came back). Upgraded to a 5 because I'm already out money, so might as well get the next best thing. I had an iPhone long ago and I will never go back to an apple product.  This phone is slim, big screen and I can do whatever I want with it.  16 gigs on the phone and I have a 64 gig sd card slapped in the back.  I will never have to worry about deleting anything off my phone to make room for... anything.|on September 23, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2197|I've been disappointed in the camera.  The feature I loved most on my S4 was the ability to take photos while taking video.  My photos and videos were always perfect.  Now when I do it, my video playback stutters at the spot where I took a photo.  :(|on September 22, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2198|I really like Android phones, and especially the Galaxy.  I bought the S5 when my S4 committed suicide by jumping off the roof of my car while I was going 45 mph.  While I like the new features, settings, etc. on the S5 the battery life in this camera doesn't come anywhere close to the battery life I had in my previous Galaxy phone.  To say the least, I am very disappointed with this phone for that very reason.  I don't use my phone a lot, I know that's relative, but my battery should make it at least half way through the day if I only have to make a couple phone calls and pull up emails a few times. I don't know if I got a lemon (battery) or it was sitting on the shelves for a long time and the battery just lost some of it's life waiting to be used.|on September 22, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2199|This is an awesome phone.  I've never had any problems with it.  It's super fast and responsive.  The screen resolution is excellent and it takes better pictures than my FIL's $1,900 Sony camera. I do have one gripe about what I consider to be an internal design flaw.  In the event of a relatively low drop from about 3 ft directly on it's front my friend had the S5 screen go blank.  It wouldn't respond to touch and was completely blank.  He asked me to look at it since it already had a small crack in in the corner of the screen and he couldn't get it warrantied.  You cannot access the display connectors on these phones from the back.  You have to remove the screen.  Using a hotplate, I warmed the display and gently separated the screen from the body.  I found that the display connector had come unplugged from the drop.  I plugged it back in and the display was working again. Why in the world would Samsung make a phone where the connector is inaccessible like this and where there's enough space for it to pop free!!!  A simple piece of foam on the connector or the back of the screen would completely solve this issue. A quick search shows several others having this same issue.  Some were able to get warranty coverage while others had to pay almost $200 to get them fixed.  It's really a simple repair that took 10 minutes. Anyway...It's an awesome phone and I recommend it to everyone but don't drop it on its face!!!|on September 22, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2204|The phone fails to be a good at making phone calls with Bluetooth or headset.  This phone does not work with integrated Bluetooth in my car.  It does not reconnect and when I do connect and make calls people I am talking to cannot hear.  I have to disconnect and talk directly with the phone. All of this worked great on my S3 phone.  When I use a headset plugged in the people I am talking to all complain about an echo.  When I try to use the speaker phone the people I talk to cannot hear.  In short the only way this phone makes a descent phone call is a standard call stuck to the side of your head. Another problem I have is when I play music.  It makes a pop noise at the start of every song.  Try hooking it up to a stereo with a wire and you will hear it very loud on every song.|on September 21, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2211|I've never had such a hard time choosing a new phone as I did this time because there's just so many good ones. After reading and watching all the reviews, it came down to priorities. With anything,  you have to know what you want out of it and how you're going to use it.  For me,  there were a few things I knew I wanted my next phone to have. 1. Removable battery 2. Good battery life 3. Great camera 4. Fast processor for web browsing 5. Android OS (used to it) Though I looked into all of the top phones to see what they all offered,  most of them were eliminated by falling short in one or more areas of my list.  They are nice phones but were not what I was looking for. I was pretty quickly able to cross off the HTC One M8, Droid Maxx, Nokia Lumina and iPhone (have one as a work phone)  for one or more reasons. That left the Galaxy S5 and LG G3.  These are the premier heavyweights on the android market right now.  I was back and forth on these 2 repeatedly until the S5 edged it out with a brighter display, narrower frame (I have small hands) and durability by way of water and dust resistance. I never once thought about what was popular or stylish. I'm also not a brand loyalist (owned Nokia, Palm, HTC and Motorola), and looked at every hand set individually. For me, a phone is a tool and it's all about functionality. I also don't need to have the latest and greatest every year either, which is why I want a removable battery, so I can replace it when I goes bad. I've had my S5 for a week now and even though it's my first "flagship" device,  it's familiar yet new in all the right ways. I'm comfortable with it yet having a good time learning new things that my older phones couldn't do. I'm happy with my choice and don't need to second guess it because I did my homework. On a side note, I found some of the review sites difficult and frustrating to read and listen to. Problem being, they've all used and or owned everything out there for years now and they're not impressed by anything unless it's totally new and original. They're also obsessed with outer appearance and want everything to have a metal casing. In short,  they're spoiled. A lot of them weren't as impressed with the S5 because they've had every Samsung Galaxy up to this point and wanted it to look and feel completely new. Well, I haven't, so it's new to me. As for the outer appearance, most of us are going to buy a case for our new phones so it's going to end up looking like that anyway. I was just a little put off by their, "we want something new" attitudes. Update: It's been 2 weeks now and I'm very impressed with the GS5. The battery life is outstanding! I can easily go 2 days off of one charge and that's something I've never been able to say before. The screen is fantastic for reading, the brightness and colors are off the charts. Everything pops on screen. Videos play smoothly and look good and the camera has tons of options and takes better pictures than any stand alone camera I've ever had. It's also very light weight and I can barely feel it in my pocket. There's still alot for me to learn though because this phone just has so many options. If you're interested, just get it, you won't be disappointed.|on September 20, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2213|All these reviews saying it's crap and they lured about it being waterproof... bunch of morons. This is water resistant, not water proof. That means if you get it wet from splashing or spilling, it will likely be fine. You cannot submerge it. If you want that capability (who in their right mind wants to submerge a phone?) Then you need to s5 active. Also, when you are writing a review about a PRODUCT, the review should be about the PRODUCT. Not the shipping, your simple mind not being able to use it because you're unwilling to learn, or even about Sprint and their idiot tech support. So %reviews.  *end rant*|on September 20, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2227|Well where do I start.Frist of all the phone is great.It was not the phone  why Im writeing a review it about getting activated. I called the number that directed me to sprint.I first talked to a  man that sounded like he was from India.I spent a good 40 minutes giving him my address 9 times my social 5 times and every 2 minutes he told me to hold 2 to 10 minutes.I was told  I was going to be directed to another man  sounded just like the man I was talking to. I was asked the same questions over and over again. This went on for 2 hours and finally it sounded like I was about to get activated he told me I had to have 2[another 60.00] lines.At this point I was getting very tired and he said I could not get activated unless he clould buy my phone 225.00 I said it a 600 phone.My wife was upset she tryied to help but It was ovious I was not going to get active.I have had Sprint for 2 years. Im 73 years and suffer from cronice back pain and disable.I was giving the run a round.I've never been treated like this ever by sprint before.|on September 18, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2233|Really cool first time using a Samsung phone and I'm surprisingly satisfied.  Iphone addicts and lovers tried to make me get an iphone and were making fun of the Galaxy S5 but now after the release of the iPhone 6 I'm even more confident with this purchase, simply love it|on September 18, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2234|Coming from an iPhone 5, I expected much better. After riding the iPhone bandwagon for years, I thought it would be a great time to switch over to Android and give it a shot. Being that this was the best phone on the market, performance wise, at the time (mid summer 2014), I went in and bought this phone blindly. This was a huge mistake. This phone is full of bugs and problems. Let me list a few: 1. Bloatware everywhere 2. Unresponsive and laggy (app applications) 3. Camera takes 20 seconds to load 4. Bluetooth audio streaming skips 5. Messages wont send half the time. 6. Phone freezes often 7. Finger print sensor doesn't recognize my finger and has almost bricked my phone before 8. Screen looks burned in and colors fade from top to bottom. 9. Have to clear text messages every other day to speed phone up This phone has so many software problems I can't even begin to get into detail. Its a shame that this phone has such amazing hardware but the software it utilizes is garbage. I feel as if this phone can't allocate RAM properly. The point of having such a fast processor and 2 Gb of RAM is so that multitasking is smooth but this is not the case. If I receive a notification while I'm in an application, the application freezes for a few seconds. God forbid I receive a few notifications in a row... I went to the store recently and played with the latest LG phones and these literally blow the S5 out of the water. The only good thing about this phone is that it takes amazing pictures in daylight. My friends love this phone, so I'm not really sure why I've had such bad experiences with this phone. My charging port wont seal properly, so I'm going to get a replacement and see if it was just my phone in particular that was causing all of these issues. Please do not buy this phone unless you can deal with a huge amount of lag.|on September 18, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
2235|Overall the phone is a winner.  The only reason that I could not give it 5 stars is that the time it takes to move from one application to another is slower than my previous Blackberry.  With the heft of Samsung's processors, the moves should be seamless.  Display is top of the line, camera functions are good, and more than enough storage space for all of my apps.|on September 18, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2247|I was going to wait to review this phone, I didn't buy it for me, I bought it for my girl. Back ground: Me - I phone 3GS to Droid Razr to Note 2 to Note 3(available for upgrade now) Her - Slider to Droid Razr to G S3 to S4 to S5(Just bought this for her) Yeah yeah, new phone, greatest and latest and all of that shtuff.  Compare apples to oranges to fragmented androids, really, just pick your poison......we are done with apple. Today, we went out to lunch and I look over from my phone to hers and I noticed how vibrant the colors are on her home screen with the icons.......wow......I was impressed.  Best looking screen in my opinion, yes I know the note 4 is suppose to have the best screen of all. So yes....I think the screen alone could sell some one on this. Only cons?  They are more with Samsung/Android devices than with the S5 in particular. *My Magazine is lame....take it off already, please. *Really swype/auto correct, sometimes I think this is programmed by non English speakers.  It really should be smarter and stop with lame auto corrects that don't make sense. *Transitions, don't know if this is software or hardware, but Samsungs seem to have trouble when you are in a program, swipe to the notification, then open a different program, lag occurs. *Wish the metal looking outside ring was metal or durable....always peels off down the road.|on September 16, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2254|I am on my third phone. I just got another replacement today in the mail from AT&T. I am not really much of a phone expert but you don't have to be to know that this is a piece of junk. AT&T tech said they oversold the phones and can not support them in my area unless they put up more towers.  I purchased a Micro Cell Booster but that did not work either. This improved the number of bars but everyone still complained. Even AT&T's techs could not call me on my phone. They called me on my iPhone so they could hear me. My messages were still going to voice mail and then I only received them 2-3 days later.  This did not just occur in my area so their other response of too many trees blocking the tower was just another ridiculous excuse. I had the Samsung Note and before that a old Samsung Flip Phone. All of Samsung products work okay for a while. I read all of the glowing reviews and I wonder how much are they getting paid by the manufacture. I just traded in my old Samsung Galaxy 5 at the AT&T store today right after my third Galaxy 5 reset itself and lost all of my emails and apps. I am so glad I switched back to Apple. I will never make that mistake again.|on September 15, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2264|I like the Samsung Galaxy S5.  I upgraded from the S3 which worked extremely well for me.  The only problems that I find are the finger print scanner doesn't work very well and is very annoying.  Also, I have the phone set up now with a PIN code to unlock the screen and before you can punch in the code the screen goes dark and you have to punch the on switch again.  I've looked for a setting to alleviate this but up until this point haven't been successful.|on September 14, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2265|love it!  its so much better than those I things.  the only thing that i wish they would have kept was the wrap around feature of screens like the s3 has.  but you can add up to 5 extra screens or only have 3.  was shocked to find it to also be able to control my tv with it.|on September 14, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2266|Gave the phone to my daughter today for her birthday. After more than an hour on the phone with Verizon tech tier 1 and 2  a ticket has been created for their engineering department. Apparently there is an issue with Verizon and the S5.  Data and text messaging works fabulously but cannot make or receive phone calls. Verizon claims that this is isolated case but now having researched the issue there are multiple threads with the exact same issue.  Hope somebody figures it fast.|on September 13, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2276|So glad we upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S2. (Sprint used to have good coverage in LA but now it sucks) Verizon has super coverage and service.  We are saving $20 a month with them and rarely get dropped calls.  The phone's speakerphone is not so good.  The s2 was 100 times better than this s5.  Perplexed on how they can make it worse?? With sprint we had a 20% discount and our bill was still higher than our new Verizon bill!  Worth the switch. We were with Sprint for over 10 yrs....|on September 12, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2290|I was a Droid Razr Maxx user and was using the jellybean OS. I had alot of trouble with it since that upgrade. I HATE HATE HATE this Samsung S5. I have excellent hearing and when talking can't hear the person. Speaker in back of phone, If I use speaker phone the phone has to be face down. The home button is annoying, the port for charging even worse. The camera in odd place. Its only day 5 but the ONLY thing I like is the keyboard. Contacts and messaging screens I don't like. That stupid cartoon face on the contact list. I can't take enough pictures to replace it. I don't need to see all info including ring tone selection for that person. Oh and I key in LADY and GAGA comes up for selection? What am I 12?? Like I need to text about her? OH an it never has my location correct? It has a place 3 towns over that I haven't been to in months? LOL This phone came highly recommended to me and I am SO SO sorry I didn't check it out further. PLUS I need 2 batteries to get through the day.  So sorry I didn't check out another MOTOROLA|on September 11, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2303|I live in Alabama and I am on the Sprint network.  Historically,  I have been an HTC customer.  In July,  I upgraded to the HTC M8.  Sleek phone and great updates.  But I couldn't talk and use internet connection simultaneously without being connected to WIFI.  That included using apps that required internet connection.  My service was also horrible especially at home.  HTC said it was the network and Sprint said the phone did have issues interfacing with their network but this was due to the manufacturer switching from the dual antenna to a single antenna.  I got a new HTC M8 and the same thing occurred.  I was told I was the only customer with this complaint.  At this point, I was three weeks into my purchase and I needed a phone.  So I reluctantly switched to the Samsung S5.  I love HTC so didn't really want to switch.  I don't like the case.  Phone looks flimsy.  Yes great device with great features but my concern is the service.  Once again, I have a phone that cannot talk and use the Internet simultaneously without being connected to the WiFi.  Single antenna. Great at home since I have WiFi but what about when I am on the go.  I have to disconnect my call and then I can use apps (that require Internet connection) or just to send an email.  My service is still poor especially at home even with the signal booster that sprint provided.  I also have 5g home network provided via charter.  My new Samsung 5 phone can't connect to it.  It connects to 2g just like my old laptop and Samsung tablet that I purchased 2 years ago. I don't know if its the phone,  the interface with the network,  or just the Sprint network.  This has been my experience and I think you should do your homework in your coverage area before you buy either the HTC M8 or Samsung S5 especially if you are in Alabama and Sprint is your carrier.  I didn't have this problem with my HTC Evo and neither of my four household members have this problem and we are all on Sprint and they use HTC Evo  and Apple 4.|on September 10, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2304|I love this phone. My S3 was dying, so I needed a new device. Considered Apple, but the ease of this transition made the decision an easy one.  I love the heartbeat monitor.|on September 10, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2306|My first smart phone. I am trying to figure everything out as it is highly customizable. My kids are more technosavvy and have given me pointers. All in all it seems like a great phone.|on September 9, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2307|I am very satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy S5. Unlike many other smartphones, it is water-resistant and contains its own Integrated Mobile Health Partner (S Health). S Health has proven to contain very accurate nutrition information on a vast amount of foods. It also possesses a heart rate detector and a pedometer, both of which can be very useful to any health-conscious individual. The phone has a very large and beautiful display but still weighs a mere 5.12 ounces. The camera on this smartphone is impeccable. I also like that you can transfer your entire iTunes library to the phone using Google Play. There is no need to download a new media player and purchase everything again. Other reviews state that the plastic on the back of the phone is a drawback but I disagree. Glass phones break very easily but I have dropped this phone multiple times without any surface damage being done. It is a considerably sturdy phone. Lastly, the S5's battery life is nothing to overlook. The advertisements state that the battery will last through 29 hours of talk time. I have personally experienced an instance showing how great the phone keeps its charge when I took it on a four hour car trip and streamed music online the entire time without losing more than 20% of the battery. After the battery dies completely, it only takes an hour and a half to charge back to 100%. Even though I highly recommend this phone to everyone, there is one very minor drawback. When setting up the phone you must create a Gmail account. This isn't an operational flaw but more of an inconvenience to the user. You now have to memorize another email address and password. Overall, this phone is worth the price tag. I plan on keeping it for a very long while.|on September 9, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2311|Replaced my old Galaxy S3 with this one. Huge leap in battery life compared with S3. Screen color is more vibrant and brighter as well. The back cover has a fake leather feel. Certainly its look is not as elegant as an iPhone but still looks better than S3 (plus, it doesn't leave fingerprints). The front and the back cameras can be used at the same time, an interesting feature. The fingerprint sensor is a bit annoying though. You have to scan by sliding your finger over the home button, and more perpendicular your finger movement to the home button is, the easier it can be recognized. Not a easy thing with one hand, but with a little practice I was able to get around 50% success rate. The heart rate sensor is not very accurate but I didn't expect it to be. What I like the least is the cover of charging port. It's a trade-off to make the phone waterproof of course. Overall I am very pleased with the purchase. I think I will finally get used to uncapping the cover as a necessary step to charge the phone.|on September 7, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2320|If you want a phone that can break and when and when/if it does, there is no guarantee you can get it replaced, than this is the phone for you! I can talk about all the things on this phone that would be good features, but what does it matter if the phone is broken. What does it matter that the phone is supposed to be "water resistant" YOU CANNOT PUT THIS PHONE IN WATER!!!. If you close the phone properly and water still gets in, they will tell you that it was still your fault that it doesn't work. Because there in unfortunately and conveniently almost no way to prove that the phone stopped working due to faulty merchandise. I bought one of these and through my warranty plan replaced it for $200.00 when my first phone broke due to water damage. Then I got a second one, of which I had for about 3 days, before it broke too. that phone broke when I went swimming. I was in shallow water, and for a very short amount of time. I made sure that everything was closed securely on this phone before I went swimming due to previous experience. When this phone stopped working, I took it to a certified Samsung repair store. The phone failed the pressure test, proving that the faulty merchandise was in fact not "water resistant at all" they also said that the corrosion in the phone was irreparable. When I called corporate with these findings from their OWN store. They said it was not SAMSUNG POLICY to replace THEIR phones even the faulty ones. That replacement can ONLY be done through your phone service provider. EVEN THOUGH THE PHONE WAS ONLY IRREPAIRABLE BASED ON THEIR FAULTY MERCHANDISE TO BIGIN WITH! We tried going through our service provider to return this phone. They wanted us to give them another $200. We would not agree to this! We decided to cancel our service completely and go with another phone service. NO one wanted to give us a working phone, or our money back! They sent us a faulty phone and offered NO GARANTEE. This phone can and will sometimes break in water. IT IS NOT a  WATERPROOF PHONE! They will not  replace it should it become irreparable, EVEN IF IT IS THEIR FAULT!!  Who wants to spends hundreds of dollars on any phone without any kind of guarantee the phone will work. IT IS SMASUNGS POLICY TO NOT STAND BY THEIR PRODUCTS. I am never buying anything Samsung again. AND not just because I am angry with how they "resolved" my issue. But also because I am concerned that I will have to deal with SAMSUNGS POOR POLICY and NO GARANTEES again! DONT BUY THIS PHONE!!!|on September 6, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2324|1st off I love this phone when it works. I have had this phone for less than 2 months ago and now it is crashing big time. I need to bring it to Sprint to try to have it fixed.  The screen keeps going black and shutting down and now it overheated so badly in a case that the edges actually started breaking off. I have never order a phone off amazon but I order everything else and have never had a problem. I am not please this is disappointing.  If sprint isnt able to fix my phone I will be beyond pissed because amazon doesnt refund or exchange phones. And just to clarify my phone has never fallen or been exposed to water. I use my phone for everything a broken one wouldnt be helpful at all which is why I'm so careful|on September 6, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

Theres, nothing it can't do! Now I've had a few of the iPhones and they are truly a very limited phone along with widows phone I believe. Sorry to so many of ya'll that believe in these overpriced nothings (never thought I'd be saying anything bad about an apple product beings I have 7 of their computers - laptops-minis plus, I have I pods and I pads but only one due to me again liking Samsung wayou better. Anywas u cant block a number apple doesn't allow it you can't even put a app up to do it go you  I don't like that I can't upp my memory in apples, or latter, change my battery if needed I can do all this and soooo soo much more. If your looking for a damp good phone and I should have the right to know cause I only used mine for a year and switched so I know most all phones out there but I've never found better than my galaxy even if it's a not  thanks for ready hopen I helped!!!|on September 6, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2328|OK, I am not an expert on all things electronic and digital, but this is one seriously impressive phone. Read others for tech details, but be aware of this happy fact: it comes GSM enabled. Slip out the SIM card, slide in a GSM card and it is ready to play internationally (as long as you have an international plan in place).  Bought as gift for family member who just returned from England. Wish we had bought it a year ago before the study-abroad year! Powerful processor provides lightning-fast downloads and uploads. Display is crisp, bright, and BIG. On-screen keyboard is larger than most and enables fewer input errors. Thin profile. Battery holds up well, considering the robust processing speed and large display. Practically plug and play. Activation was nearly hands-free, requiring only two response clicks.  Excellent delivery time and value. Looking forward to a lot of fun with this phone. At time of purchase, this model was 50% of the price at the carrier's store, and came GSM equipped. If you had doubts about ordering your next mobile this way, dispel all worries and dive in. The experience has been completely positive, loads better than dealing with a salesperson face-to-face in a brick-and-mortar store.|on September 6, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2330|Great phone, a good upgrade from my S3, which was beginning to overheat (battery problem??) and had a cracked screen (user problem!!!). Good call quality, usually better signal strength, faster app execution, longer battery life. Camera is okay, but a few quirks, especially with my bank's app - framing the check is harder and it sometimes won't focus properly on the back side of the check (no lines near the center to focus upon). This is minor and I've adjusted (and perhaps the bank app has upgraded, too?). My only knock is that the security fingerprint unlock is not really ready for everyday use. I was able to store my primary unlock finger in two of the three profiles to get it to work better, but still had issues with sweaty or dirty fingers, or problems when the phone was not a quite the right angle. I cannot image anyone being unhappy with this phone.|on September 5, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2331|I love the phone...most of the time.  I don't know if it's mine or if others have had this problem, but the camera is very glitchy.  Sometimes I get the spinning circle like it's thinking about taking a picture, but doesn't actually do it.  Other times, I can push the button 5 times and nothing happens.  If I'm lucky, it does take the pic the first time, but there's a second or so delay even when it does work...not great. The only other complaint I have is that I sometimes have to push the same button several times when I'm trying to delete emails.  I'm pretty sure it's not me, but another minor glitch. Reception is great, videos run pretty smoothly, no problems with games, books, music, etc.|on September 5, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2335|I was an owner of the S3 and S4 and decided to switch things up and try the new HTC One M8.  That was a mistake.  Although it's a great phone, the S5 is hands down the best phone I've owned.  Processing is fast and the screen is gorgeous.  Notification lights are a huge bonus over the HTC.  Call quality and signal is better as well.  The S5 is also very light and comfortable in my hand, and the new dimpled back is not nearly as slick as the HTC One which I struggled to handle when it wasn't in it's case.  I'll be sticking with the Galaxy line for a long time.|on September 5, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

Screen resolution is amazing.  Don't even want to look at another phone screen now, it hurts my eyes!  lol|on September 4, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2347|Pros Phone has a nice Display not to small and not oversized Phone fits in my hand well without being akward Display is OLED so the colors really POP. Some people do not like that but i like the colors are crisp and brilliant Camera has lots of features and takes better pictures than the old phone. Speakers sound clear and more crisp Charges a lot faster. I have to admit I didn't think it would be charged when I picked it up Battery life seems to be longer than any phone I have previously had The Samsung S5 colors to choose from aren't bad Touchwiz UI is easy enough to navigate Phone boots very quickly and is extremely responsive S Health is pretty fun to play with Cons Ships with Bloatware that is annoying and must be turned off. Not a super big deal but worth mentioning Charging Port cover is a little tricky to open New Charging port style is tricky to plug into the new phone. I usually am very patient but I can get a little frustrated at times Phone back is plastic which makes it feel kinda cheap. I'm guessing Samsung did this to make it one of the lightest Other Thoughts I really like this phone and am happy I upgraded to it but I really would of liked to see something other than a plastic back and some other choices in colors other than Black,White and Gold. The phone before was a Samsung Stratosphere so I can definitely see a lot of maturity from Samsung. I hope Samsung would put less Bloatware and continues to develop the user interface and other features.|on September 4, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2353|Switched from Moto/Droid to Samsung. Some of the UI tweaks that Moto does are better (dock mode, "real" swype,) but Samsung over all has done a nice job here. Not sure why the S5 is seen as a miss, it's my first Samsung and I'm happy with it.|on September 3, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2354|Love the Galaxy S5.  The only downside is the charging port, it's very hard to get open.  Was a little disappointed that they changed the charging port configuration which meant I had to purchase all new chargers for my car and additional for travel.|on September 3, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2362|I researched  'my next new smart phone'  for one whole month.  It was painfully clear;  'My next phone MUST be that Samsung Galaxy S5!'  I spent two more months reading everything about it and trying to figure out; 'HOW can I put myself in line to afford it, hummm'.  When I found the solution,  I purchased 'MY' S5 - causing me to love every bit of the voyage'.  Now that's the way one MUST respect the technology. Samsung has once again acquired an 'apple-pie-paramount'!|on September 2, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2364|An amazing phone! Upgraded from an S3, the S5 is feature rich, with faster speed,  nice camera app, bio readings and other cool features. Vastly superior to iPhone, which I used for two years. If you would like the best phone available today, the S5 is the best I have found to date...|on September 2, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2365|I've owned everyone of the Samsung Galaxy series phones with the exception of the S2 and my new S5 is simply amazing! Hands down their best work yet! Screen quality is amazing, the camera is a major upgrade vs my S4, battery life is improved. It did take a little getting use to not having a settings button on the bottom left anymore but other than that I LOVE it and you will to.|on September 2, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2366|Been very happy with the phone. A huge improvement over my S3. Size isn't an issue since I have big hands. Battery life is excellent.|on September 1, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2367|If you are an Iphone person you will not like some of the features on this phone. First off, it's not as user friendly as the IPhone. Secondly it's so big that it's like trying to eat a slice of pizza by holding the entire pizza in your hand. Thirdly it doesn't have all the apps for the new operating system that I really used a lot It does have some plus's though. The battery lasts so long that you swear that it will never run out and when you go to the ultra power savings mode it lasts even longer This thing will not drop a call, I think I could make a call from under my house and it would not drop it If you have enough light to see the camera will take a picture in low light areas that will amaze you. I hope that if you are buying this expecting to get a better product than you had before (especially if you are an apple person) you will look at what you use that is easy on your phone and see if you want to mess with it on the android phone. I'm still not sure I bought the right phone and will have to mess with it a little longer before I know|on September 1, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2371|No good|on August 30, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
2372|Purchased online through Amazon and added to existing Verizon Family account for one of the phones on the plan that was eligible for upgrades.  Easy transition from iPhone 4 to new Galaxy S5 using the Samsung transition application downloaded on an iMac. Great phone.  Better than the S4 with minor details.  If you're already an S4 owner, wait until the Note 4 or next year with an S6. The copper color is interesting if you're not going to use a case.  Definitely distinctive, so you won't confuse your phone with others.  So many people go for basic black or white.  Here, we installed an Otter Defender case, PINK in color, so the only copper visible is by the camera port and it looks almost like gold trim...very nice.|on August 30, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2374|Oh, Another year, another set of phones from manufacturers! I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. I will not call Samsung Galaxy S5 as revolutionary, but it is certainly evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. I love Samsung Galaxy S5 from its competitors for few reasons - removable battery, microSD card support and the maturity of the product. I have been using a S5 for past couple of days and have ordered a unlocked one from my local store. There are so many variants already in the market. So do check local specs. For example, in china market dual SIM S5 is available. Galaxy S5's back plate has a perforated dot pattern and a excellent matte finish. As a result, the phone looks far more sophisticated than its past designs despite its plastic build. Its surface feels nice to the touch without being too rough or too slippery. I really do _not_ care about the plastic, in fact the lightweight nature is what I care. Some people make a huge deal out of it. A high quality plastic is good for lightweight and I go with lightweight than a heavy phone in the pocket. A reputed tech site called recently Samsung as the “undisputed king of the Android smartphone space”. True indeed. With the plethora of devices in tablets/phones, they have iterated so much that they can produce truly stunning products. If you care for weight, the Galaxy S4 is lighter than S5. (please see my stats below). In fact pixel density is slightly higher in S4 due to a 0.1in size difference. So get an S4, it is cheaper and still same phone that came out last year. If you care for heart rate monitor, fingerprint scanner, and water proof, get the S5. Otherwise literally similar set and you can save a lot by getting S4 now. Last year when S4 came out it was a great phone. It still is, though S5 came out now. Obsoletion is in the mind of the us, not on the devices. In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don’t advertize or mention SAR prominently. phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating} Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, MSM8974-AC Processor: Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body) Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version): 5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body) HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body) LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body) Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body) Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body) Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body) Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body) Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body) Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important. SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION: I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5” is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, but after using Note for a while, I don’t use it as a primary phone. The display in S5 is absolutely stunning with a Super AMOLED display and you have to see to feel it! ANDROID UI: S5 has Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. User Interface hasa flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently to my friends shows the details of processes. battery usage like which process takes up more battery, Qi charging receivers for wireless charging on Galaxy phones and they were in awe. WATER PROOF: Obviously I have not tested this!, but a very nice to have feature and gives a peace of mind CAMERA: This can just replace a point and shoot camera. Wait, what is a point and shoot camera?! Very impressive. S5 has a 16MP camera with super-fast autofocus, HDR mode with real-time preview, and support for 4K video recording. Definitely state of the art. I took several indoor photos and they look great. It will be interesting to see how photos appear in a vanilla S5 which Google will release. S-HEALTH: I rely and use S-Health more than any other app in my Galaxy S5. It has driven my fitness regimen to a very good progress and the design of app is nothing short of buttery and beautiful. I am often too in good favor of Samsung loading the phones with S-Ware, but their design of S-Health is definitely breathtaking. Heart rate monitor is a great addition to the fitness tools. I used it for walking several steps and found it same as in S4. PROCESSING POWER: Don’t bother about it. For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth. Qi WIRELESS CHARGING: I wonder why Samsung does not release wireless charging built in. You have to get a external Qi wireless charger and open the back, align it and use with a Qi charger. It should be integrated, but you can do it after the fact. NFC Tags: Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. Get bunch ( I mean around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example in my S4, when I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both. I am programming my S5 also to do host of things. 128 GB Micro SD card!! This is just incredible. If you see my reviews, I have been saying having external capacity is very key. With a 4K camcorder you can fill your space in a blink of the eye. Movies take up space. Who would have thought a 128 GB tiny card can fit in a phone. This is just incredible. I tested with a 128 GB and it works wonderfully! A 16 GB phone memory will have around 10 GB spare initially. OTG - USB Hosts: This is also often ignored feature in many reviews. On the GO USB cable + S5 means you can use with external hard disks, and virtually many of USB devices. If you have a thumb drive and have files, you can in fact read with a phone and don’t necessarily have to open a laptop. works out of the box. BATTERY: Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I don’t. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy! MISC FEATURES: I tested fingerprint scanner, but I am not sure how reliable it will be over time with scratches/oily fingers etc. I have to test it further, but for now I will settle on traditional passwords till bugs are ironed out. Apple’s initial fingerprint software had bugs which was fixed subsequently. There are so many other features in S5. Some of them have become so standard that they are not review worthy! e.g., Infrared for wireless remotes, GPS etc. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), TOM TOM, , Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Currents (nice way to read News), Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they hve for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google Voice Ask questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S5. I will be glad to answer any questions within 24 hours.|on August 29, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2388|I loved my S3, envied my husband's S4, and now adore my S5. The screen is great, apps work wonderfully and the phone feels powerful. I wish the speakers were a bit better, to be honest, but I mostly use headphones of external bluetooth speakers anyway, so it's not a big deal for me. I especially love the built-in power saving features. Kept my phone going for a 9 day camping trip, with just one recharge from a portable battery. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the camera. It's just kinda slow, and it kills your battery life. The quality of the pictures is good though, and I love that my phone puts everything right to Dropbox and G+ for easy backup and sharing. Overall, I'm very happy with this phone.|on August 28, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2390|The phone itself is OK but the Cover Flap where you plug it in broke already.  This is apparently a known defect as a lot of people are having the same problem and the new part is not cheap.  I am just ordering a new one because I don't want the hassle of dealing with their tech support.  Most people said they wanted people to send in the phone to have that part replaced so you would have to wait 10 days or longer to get it back.  This is a design flaw.  I was very careful with this phone and never yanked it off but it just broke off anyway.  This is for Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900F USB Cover Flap.  It is a piece of garbage...,|on August 27, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars

2393|Since receiving this phone, I get occasional blank screen. The lights will come on for the application selection and back back buttons, but the phone does nothing. Sometimes I can tap it just right (a gentle nod to the old days when smacking a TV would make it come back to life) but I do no more than a typical tap. Ultimately I end up either pulling out the battery and putting it back in which seems to work so far, or I have to try to do a hard restart by holding the power button in until it gives up, then turn it back on. With those seeming to work and the occasional tap, I must assume that the issue is an electronics connection on the motherboard or between the video card and display. Another, unrelated(?) issue is I will occasionally get an error message that either the SIM card or SD card are disconnected, but when I check it, it appears to be as snug as possible. I have been a huge fan of Samsung phones owning the Epic, S3, S4, S5 and even the Note 2014. I don't know if the supplier gets "potentially unwanted" batches and takes a gamble or if this is an issue I have so far been fortunate enough to avoid, but some research suggests I'm not alone. Some home remedies include resoldering the motherboard, but I don't want to risk warranty voiding. I was also told by a Sprint rep that phones not purchased directly from the store or website are not supported by the representatives in the store. So where do I go? I give it two stars because it has some really convenient features that I love using when it works, but then I get a phone call during "Blank Screen" and I sit there helpless wondering who called and if it is important. Am I alone or did others have this experience with their Amazon s5 purchase?|on August 27, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
2394|My newest smartphone is the  Samsung Galaxy S5, Copper Gold 16GB (Verizon Wireless) .  We have Samsung Galaxy S5 phones and an HTC One M8 and find that although the HTC is much more attractive, the Samsung is the phone we are using on Verizon Wireless, our carrier. The Samsung case is plastic, its biggest flaw in my opinion, whereas the HTC is more sturdy. The copper gold color is very attractive,but I always use a protective case and a screen sheet protector. one has a much better camera, a keyboard which contains numerals, and removable battery. The HTC has better audio and a more initially intuitive system navigation. The audio on the Samsung is not great and I often do not hear notifications when the phone is placed face upright. With the rear speaker, it's better having the rear facing upright for a clearer sound. As with any Android phone now, it arrives with applications that are unwanted, so I've been able to clear off some but not all. If you are interested in monitoring your steps, exercise and food intake, a very nice app is built in. My only problem with this one is the reminders after I've not used it for a few days. I do like the ability to check the pulse. You have several options for locking your phone, with an interesting fingerprint option. Battery life on this phone isn't terrible and it isn't great either, so I am using the power saver function.  I like to know there is an extreme setting should I become in need of truly extending the battery life. Samsung's power ports are their own style, imagine a USB with a conjoined smaller twin. It's the same type as my daughter's Samsung Galaxy tablet. The enclosed ear buds are pretty good, too.  All in all, I really like the phone and think it's the best I can get right now for camera capabilities. For audio, the HTC wins.|on August 27, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

It has a thing to check you heart beat and a Pedometer. And a way to keep trace of your calories. And many other thing I have not started using yet.

2412|After reading the reviews, I was under the impression that the Android OS was more stable than it had been in previous versions of the Galaxy. I had an S4 and liked it well enough, but the constant crashing and lagging led me back to the iPhone. I thought the S5 would be different - I was wrong. App crashes - happens at least once a day, usually when I move too fast through the app/apps. This never happened on my iPhone...it kept up with me. This phone does not. Unlocking/Lag - I had it set to password unlock and had to go back to fingerprint because every time I tried to use the PIN number, it would only recognize 2 or 3 of the numbers or take 15 seconds to allow me to input my PIN at all. Fingerprint recognition is not preferred, but it seems to be the only security lock feature that actually works 90% of the time. This is the same type of issues I have with most apps - takes a long time to load and then lags horribly throughout use. Picture quality - The picture quality is superior to iPhone when it comes to zooming, etc, but the camera app takes forever to open (10-15 seconds) so it's not great for those in-the-moment pics I love to grab. Battery - I read so many reviews that said the battery life was much better, but it just isn't. I have to carry my charger with me to work every day because my battery will die before I get home in the evening if I don't. Standby time is superb....but I don't have a smartphone so it can sit and be pretty on my night stand. All in all, I'm really disappointed with the Galaxy S5 and, when my account is ready for upgrade, I will be getting an iPhone and not leaving it again. Update 10/2/14: After 2 months of having this phone, my lag issues got exponentially worse to the point that I couldn't even answer a call in time without it going to VM and most of the time I couldn't even get my phone to unlock because the fingerprint scanner lagged out. Absolutely ridiculous. I'm happy to say that I now have the iPhone 6 and am MUCH happier.|on August 25, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

2415|I cannot say enough about this phone. Battery is amazing, screen shimmers, camera to die for, and functionality like you wouldn't believe. Not even a debate that it's the best phone on the market right now and for a while. Can't wait to see what Samsung comes up with next.|on August 23, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2416|I replaced my 2-yr old i-phone 4 with the S5.  After about 30 days of use, there is very little I do not like about the S5.  It is actually a much better phone than the old apple.  Bigger and better screen.  Easier to use.  The speaker is not that great though.  Still 5 stars for me. This following comment does not apply to the phone: even without changing carrier, it was a bit difficult to transfer voice mail.|on August 23, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2417|Hello I just LOVE MY NEW G S 5 Phone. Ive not had a new phone in all most 5 yr's. And wasn't going to get one until  another yr. But I had to . I had heard so much about the Galaxy S 5 phone. So I look in to it. Then I found a great deal on Amazon. So I'm please to say I got a two in one deal. Great phone from a great company for a awesome deal.

2422|I had my S2 for years and it was a better phone.  For the first week the S5 had great battery life, but it suddenly started dropping for no apparent reason. I deleted a bunch of bloat ware apps and disabled the ones I couldn't remove. They literally reinstalled themselves. I disabled the auto upgrade feature,  but somehow it didn't help. If I don't use the phone and keep it in ultra power saving mode (which turns off all the background stuff and makes everything black and white), the phone is dead by two o'clock PM. I charge it overnight and it is at full charge when I leave for work at five o'clock AM. I bought this because of its battery life. A complete waste of money. I should have kept my S2.|on August 22, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2427|I'm a bit disappointed. I had the S3 before I bought the S5, and I rarely had problems with the phone freezing up on me, but now the S5 seems to freeze up on me quite often. Overall I like the phone, but the freezing up can get annoying.|on August 22, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2430|Did not order black.  It was sent instead of white, but as a surprise.  Cool way to show how customer-friendly you are.  Then it takes ten days to get the upgrade off your phoneserviceprovider account so you can order the white one from someone who actually has it.  You just cannot make up this kind of material.  Stranger than fiction.|on August 21, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2438|The phone is awesome. The Verizon Upgrade Fee of $30.00 is completely outrageous, though. Not only I did commit to a 2-year contract, but they had to also bill me for basically nothing - I bought the phone from a supplier (Amazon), did the settings on my own and dealt with the mess of the non-working Backup Assistant. Amazon also should have been open about this charge from the beginning of my purchase (so that the cost of a new Samsung Galaxy is not 99.99 but 129.99) and not hide it in the second or third step of the ordering process right after signing the three terms & conditions documents.|on August 18, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2443|It's an awesome flagship phone. It's probably the most durable of current flagship phones on the market right now (quality plastic without cheap feel, better than easily broken glass and dented aluminum). The water/dust proofing also contributes to improved durability, and of course it has Gorilla Glass 3. Additionally, the design is very portable and comfortable, despite the size. The performance is top-par, running on multi-core benchmarks as the current fastest. 1080p screen is flawless, for those desiring 4K quality of the LG G3, consider the fact that physiologically you can't really even tell the difference on a phone-size screen between 1080p and quad until it's within 6 inches from your eyes. Touch-wiz is wonderful to use, and the phone is loaded with small conveniences, both in hardware and touchwiz. The small features I have found useful include the IR emitter with smartremote app, heart rate monitor (and S-Health app in general, it's an awesome fitness application), one-hand use, ultra power saving mode (extreme battery life), multi-window, private mode, and the fingerprint lock (more for convenience than security: it's secure but quicker than a pattern or code). The camera is about as good as you'll find, though there are a few specific camera-phones out there with better features. Battery life is one of the most important things to me, and the standard battery with normal usage is excellent; the best of current flagships excluding the Motorola Droid Maxx, and the power saving options allow you to bring the usage down so low as to get several days on a charge (if you use it only for calling and messaging, like your old flip phone). I have absolutely no complaints so far.|on August 17, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2457|I recently upgraded from a Galaxy S3 to the Galaxy S5. There were several key improvements that made the switch worthwhile. 1. Waterproofing. I'm a photojournalist and occasionally get caught in the rain. I'm reassured that my expensive phone won't get trashed even if I get soggy as a flounder. Also, do you know how many people drop their phones in toilets, pools or puddles? It's a LOT! You need to seal the charging port with an annoying little flap at the bottom, though, which makes finding a desktop charging cradle problematic. 2. Larger / better screen. I'm a big guy and really like a decent-sized phone. Plus I use Google Maps while driving so a tiny screen just doesn't cut it. The S5 screen is slightly larger and sharper than the excellent S3 screen; great for reading eBooks and watching movies and useable even in daylight. 3. Astonishing battery life! When I first bought the S5, I was lucky to get a full day off a charge. But in September there was a big firmware update (4.4.4--now 5.0 Lollipop) which increased the battery life dramatically! I leave just about everything running, yet an astonishing 80-90% battery power remains after 14 hours! Furthermore the new "Ultra Power Saving Mode" is an emergency option that shuts down all but the basic communication functions while extending the last gasp of battery life for DAYS. This could be a literal life saver. The S5 charges faster with its new USB 3 charger, but it also charges with standard legacy USB 2 chargers. No funky adapter needed; REALLY nice engineering tweak! 4. Camera. The camera in the new S5 is far better than the S3's camera. I was startled at its quality and ability to shoot under low light. 5. Snappy operation / Using Verizon. The new processor makes the S5 a bit snappier than the S3. Sometimes I use Verizon's Mobile Office to link my laptop to the internet when working in the field. Verizon is awfully expensive, but they have a superior system, especially during emergencies like hurricanes and power outages. Lesson verified during Ike and Katrina. CONS: Of course, Verizon loads their usual loathsome crapware on your new phone; this junk cannot be uninstalled. Furthermore, Samsung felt free to shovel its own steaming pile on top of Verizon's. And watch out for the Google+ app. One setting automatically uploads your photos into the cloud, which can be disastrous away from WiFi on a limited data plan. Neat phone, though, with some spiffy advanced software. Many of the software upgrades are useless, but I quite like the feature that keeps the screen active if it "sees" your face with the front camera. Also, I like the NFC sensor. I bought a five-pack of Samsung's TecTiles and downloaded the free "NFC Task Launcher" to program the tiles to perform various tedious tasks--like turning off WiFi and turning on Bluetooth when getting into the car. Another one fires up Google Maps while boosting screen brightness. The S3 is a fine device, so don't feel you must upgrade. But the S5 has several distinct improvements and, if you cell plan allows, it is worth it. UPDATE: After many months of reliable service, the annoying little bottom flap needed for S5 for waterproofing broke off. Replacement flaps are available for less than two bucks.|on August 14, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2470|I purchased this phone in May 2014, worked ok after I got on the phone with my carrier, the reception is bad (very Bad) I had to activate my airave in order for it to work in my home.  In July the phone started freezing up, turning off on it's own, had to take out the battery for it to come back on only for a short period of time. Finally I took it to my carrier and they told me that I had too many apps (beloney), because I had the same apps on my Samsung Galaxy s3. After trips to the repair center, many, many, tooooo Many phone conversations, they my carrier will be sending me a new phone. On the other hand when the phone "Worked" I did like it and hope the new one works fine!|on August 12, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2484|Purchased a S5 on 7/23/14 through Verizon Wireless and it had one problem after another.  In the first few days, it took three Verizon Wireless Customer Service Reps to set up the email functions.  Ironically, the primary email was a Verizon email address.  None of the Reps considered the set up to be a "hardware" issue.  I discussed replacing this Samsung with a new unit, but they asked me to try more solutions.  Then on the 16th day, two days after the 14-day return policy expired, the phone failed so completely that it could not make calls or text messages.  Finally on the 17th day after the purchase, Verizon acknowledged that it was a hardware problem and agreed to replace it with a refurbished unit.  I asked for a different model or a brand new unit, the Verizon Rep denied the request because the "return" was made a couple days after the 14-day return policy based on the arrangement with Samsung, and they had too much inventory on Samsung S5 to offer another brand.  The Rep did not consider the first three technical calls to be "hardware" related, even though email had been working perfectly fine on the old Motorola phone just an hour before switching to Samsung.  Everyone of the Reps blamed the issues with the third party app developer not working properly with Android devices.  They alluded that Facebook, Yelp, and many other popular apps would "interfere" with the performance of the phone.  The phone was bad to start with, Verizon service made the experience even worse.  Please explore other options when consider buying this phone.  I will switch to another wireless carrier the first opportunity.|on August 10, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2487|SO I had the Samsung Galaxy S5, Black 16GB (Sprint) since June 2014 and all i can say is that it is a great product. i looked up so many reviews and specs on this Galaxy s5 before placing my order. Its really fast and well mad. Im not going to go all out on the specs in my reviews. I just want to hit on some key things I think some people would want to know. First thing i want to talk about is the heartbeat reader. i have tried to use it a few times at after my warm up at the gym. The app is pretty useful for the step counter. I love the way it puts it in a bar graph for you, its really helps you keep a eye on those burn calories. But the heartbeat reader just doesn't work all that well. Good new tho! Its a App and there alot of other one out there, im you find one that you like. Now H2O proof? No its not, but it is water resistant. So if it rainy outside or someone hand you it in the shower no worries. It will still work just fine. But DONT swim with it, It wont be the same and mostly like die on you later. But if you really really need to swim with your phone, there are "some" cases out there CLAME it will make it water proof. that's its 4/5 stars only because there's always room for improvement. I was kinda just hopeing that Samsung would had included a Samsung MicSD 16 evo card with it by the time i got it, but no luck.|on August 10, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2497|I've had my AT&T S5, purchased from Amazon on sale for one week. I am very pleased with my purchase and find the phone to be a great improvement over my old Sky Rocket S2 in every way. Pros: Battery life - Average 1.5 days between recharging with moderate use. Big beautiful screen - The color and sharpness are amazing. I keep the brightness turned way down which probably helps the battery life. Speed - This thing is fast!! KitKat - Wonderful improvement over Jelly Bean. Everything just works and integrates well. Fingerprint scanner - Provides a reasonable amount of security with ease of use. It has worked well for me. Cons: Size and Weight - this phone is large and heavier but this is a reasonable trade off for increased screen size and battery life. Samsung apps - Turned almost all of them off. Not really of value to me With Nova Launcher installed this phone has exceeded my expectations. Combined with a under ninety dollar sale price for a two year contract and I have IMO the best value currently available at AT&T.|on August 9, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2500|Samsugn Galaxy has always seemed ahead of the game with bigger screens and excellent software. Bought this for my wife. She loves it after having the Galaxy S3. The dust and water proofing works well as our toddler has got a hold of her phone a couple of times and has spilled water on it. The screen is brighter than older S models and the camera is very nice. Looks like HD. Definitely a fan of the Galaxy S series. We look forward to west the future holds as this is by far the best Galaxy phone yet.|on August 9, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2501|My previous phone was a Samsung S2, which I really liked & intended on keeping, but the charger port went bad and it would do all sorts of bizarre things, including drain the battery in 2 hours.  So I took the plunge.  This is a great phone, but here's the beef & why I didn't give it 5 stars...  ATT is why.  I'm not singling ATT out for any particular reason other than the deceptive way they treat customers.  The price you will be quoted here on Amazon is NOT the price you will actually pay.  They warn you there are other fees, but will not tell you what they are other than the $40.00 initiation fee.  Well, people, there are so many fees you'll pay a huge amount over the online quote.  And the $80.00 a month charge for the 2 gig mobile sharing plan listed here is likewise not really what it's going to cost you.  All those unlisted fees and surcharges will cost you $94.88 in the end, almost $15.00 a month, or $180.00 per year, over what you thought you were signing up for.  This has gotta stop.  Won't one of you politicians submit a bill requiring service providers to tell you up front EXACTLY what all the charges are going to be?  This is like living in the Ukraine. That said, the S5 is a great phone.  More bells & whistles than you can ever use.  Samsung, why can't you pre-load all your phones with a pdf of the owners manual?  That shouldn't add hardly anything to the cost & would really help your customer base.  For the uninitiated, these phones come without directions, so you'd better have a PC at home so you can go to Samsung's website to see how to install the SIM & memory card, 'cause the included Quick Start Guide doesn't tell you that important procedure. The camera is a fantastic improvement over the S2.  Much clearer and many cool options, but a digital camera will take much better pictures, so don't expect miracles here.  The size of the lens does matter, so while the marketing data on the camera has impressive numbers, my 1994 Canon 4 meg digital camera takes exponentially clearer pictures than this phone.  It's all in the lens. The phone is really thin.  Take an S2, make it thinner, stretch it vertically, and you have the S5.  Some complain it feels cheap.  Really?  Not to me.  It's light, thin, and compact.  Considering what this phone does, I'm impressed with it's diminutive size & weight.  One change that I'm finding difficult adjusting to are the Home & Back buttons, and the new one on the left you press to dispaly which apps were recently in use.  This last one is really handy, as we all tend to use mostly the same handful of apps, and this is a really quick way to open them up. The battery life is wonderful.  A charge lasts me about 2 days with substantial use.  The battery is about a third larger than in the S2, charges very quickly thanks to the higher tech charging plug, and even still accepts the old version of a mini usb port charger so in a pinch you can still use your old charging cables, especially if you have a car charger.  I really like that.|on August 7, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2519|Have had the phone half a day.  I agree with most of the positive reviews of the phone and coming from a Droid 3, it took me a while to get the hang of the new interface and download all the apps I had purchased on the Droid.  To my surprise, Verizon (or my sdcard) remembered which apps I had purchased and I was able to download and reinstall free of charge.  Saved me about $20 in apps alone.  Phone is big and easy to read, but not too big, and surprisingly light and thin (remember this morning I was still using my Droid3 brick).  Some important observations: 1) The included headphones are totally lacking base and sound washed out.  Not even close to the quality of the Creative Zen I was using so I will continue with the Zen.  2) When ordering on Amazon, I chose the "replace a phone on my existing account" option.  But the checkout chose to change my data plan and "estimated" I will be paying $40 more a month than I was.  Called Amazon and Verizon and the consensus was to let the sale go through and change the plan back when I activate the phone.  Well after activating on the phone, the plan did not change.  So all is well.|on August 5, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2520|I have also owned the S3 & S4. This phone did not disappoint.  I have absolutely no complaints about the S5.Amazon shipped it fast!!! THANKS|on August 5, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2521|Simply love this phone---I'm slowly, but surely learning to use it, but am sure I haven't even made a dent in what it is capable of doing!  My hubby has an S3, and I'm having to pry my S5 away from him as he plays with all the features.  I think he'll want one when he gets the next upgrade.  I had no trouble at all using my upgrade through Verizon to qualify and register for this phone---and it came very quickly---faster than they estimated.|on August 5, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2522|Personally, I hate it. It's not as fast as my Apple 4S (no, I'm not an Apple fan, I hated my Apple too), it's slow to take screen shots, it doesn't edit pics as fast or as well, the internet is "clunky," and it doesn't switch from 4G to wifi as it should.  It generally tells me that my "connection is lost" and I have to manually turn off the wifi to get the 4G to kick in. Additionally, as intrusive as Apple is into your device and personal life, Google is far, far worse.  People complain that Apple is product centric and everything has to be Apple, Google is no different. I hate them both.  If I had it to do over again I would have gone with the LG phone.|on August 5, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
2523|I don't understand what all the hype is about with the iPhone retina display, but it is no where comparable to the Samsung Galaxy S5 beautiful design, color saturation, and very responsive screen.There are a lot of features such as infrared remote sensor and apps that connects us with the world. I went from an iPhone 5 to this and instantly fell in love. I updated the phone and made sure I keep my apps up to date and this phone is solid and efficient. Also love how I can say Google without opening a particular app and it responds with an inquiry. Google maps is high tech and just by only stating one command of your specific location, it will search the nearest location you are seeking and navigate you there. Awesome phone.|on August 5, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2524|I'm not sure. I might have got a bad phone, but it's beyond the return period. having purchased it from Amazon, I can't take it back to the ATT store to get looked at, and don't want to give up my phone for days or weeks to get it looked at. The apps don't work as well as on the iphone, particularly the apps that stream music or baseball have many more interuptions and shut down more frequenlty than happened on the iphone. And it occassionaly freezes up, the only remedy I've found is to take the battery out of the back. Like I said, maybe I just got a bad phone, maybe it's the way I'm operating the phone. That said, doubt I'd get another samsung next time. I regret my choice and should have gone with HTC phone.|on August 5, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

The 16-MP Rear Camera takes great pictures and video (for a phone). The quick charging ability of the USB 3.0 is a plus.

2549|This is my first Android device, I previously enjoyed the iPhone & Windows Phones, but after purchasing this one I might just never go back.  I am crazy about Google Play Store, blows Windows Store & iTunes out of the water.  This phone is both beautiful and sleek.  Light easy to hold, great camera (though no comparison to Nokia models).  So far the only thing I really don't like is the difficulty in navigating menus & the notification management is confusing.  Though I imagine I'll probably overcome that once I become more familiar with the device (though having the search feature common on Windows Phones would be a great addition!).|on July 31, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2550|I've owned this phone since it came out.  I decided to use it for a while before I wrote my review. I upgraded from an iPhone 4S. You can look at all the positive reviews on this site if you are looking for that info.  I would like to focus on the things that irritate me the most, to the point that I regret buying this phone. If anyone knows any fixes for these issues please leave in the comments. If anyone else has experienced these issues, please comment and check as  helpful review thanks! . Annoying things about S5 It constantly loses default settings. Freezes and won't restart. When the phone rings touch is unresponsive and I can't answer. Sometimes when I'm on a call touch is unresponsive and I can't use the keypad. When I set certain apps to not send push notifications, once I restart the phone, its all forgotten. The chrome around the bezel is already coming off. The brightness in a dark setting is still too bright even on auto adjust. I have to manually do it. The piece that covers the charging port no longer seals correctly. Now the phone is no longer waterproof. Unless you are wall charging the phone, it'll charge at a slow 1% per 10 minutes. Constantly drops wifi signal. Constantly says security update failed regardless of how many times I try to update it. When switching to video mode it automatically starts recording video. Every time I plug headphones in and raise the volume it warns me how loud music can damage my hearing. I have to click ok to continue or I can't raise the volume. Other issues that may have slipped my mind,  but the default settings issue is the most irritating.|on July 31, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars

2556|Memory leak: Device has system issue (system is to heavy for memory capabilities) and device is definitely not fast enough for $660. Sliding is bad and slow, reaction on your action is slow and irresponsible specially when device is searching for networks (well it does that anytime you move or finds new networks, loses signal with access point etc...). Bluetooth : Usually I had to restart device just to add Bluetooth device or to assign new one, sometimes even just to turn ON Bluetooth. Charging cable :Charging cable is new tech and in the dark room or room with dimmer light  it is extremely difficult to attach it to device. Beside that, charging cable is so firm cannot band it and looks like hard wire jumping out from my wall. Design: Design  is excellent, weight is awesome it feels good weight when is in your hand (some people consider it slippery but this smart phone is almost tablet size, so it's fine) Locking Phone: Locking phone I found very difficult to setup, even fingerprint is difficult specially when one hand used.So requires two hands and sometimes fails on reading even when used with two hands...|on July 30, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2558|Call me old fashioned, but I didn't get a cell phone until 2007, and then the simplest of flip phones. I was tired of the little phone that was basically only good for talking to someone or texting, and everybody seemed fascinated by their smart phones, so I recently took the plunge and purchased this phone. Don't get me wrong here, it is an excellent "mini computer," but a with a portable phone, you should be able to safely and comfortably carry it in your pocket, and with this, it's no easy task. I work on cars, so I can't really lug this phone around without sacrificing comfort or having to worry about a cracked screen. I would trade this in for a small fliphone any day. My computer can do almost everything this phone can do anyway.|on July 28, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

2561|Worst phone ever and worst customer service. Samsung advertises water resistant phone up to 3 meters. My phone got a drop of water on it and caused a short in the phone. I sent the phone back to samung for warranty repair and they said the phone is water damaged. Where does the water resistent come in to play in this phone? Samsung is totally misleading there customers by stating the S5 is water resistant.

2566|Have no idea how this phone gets good reviews. Aside from android being absurdly terrible as an operating system Samsung decides to go in and add its little "tweaks" resulting in constant force closes, 15 second camera boot up time (wtf?!) and non stop issues with email setup and MMS issues. I'm no newbie with software and hardware but it seems that both cell phone manufacturers and software companies are going backwards. Just to sum up my observations: Pros: nice screen, water resistant, long battery life. Cons: cheap feel, poor fingerprint scanner (does not catch finger print 50% of the time), absolutely horrible os (it is android so no surprise there), force closes in apps several times a day, camera takes no joke 15 seconds to load when you try to open it... I "upgraded" from the iPhone 5S a few months back because of the ridiculous screen size on the iPhone waiting for the iPhone 6 to arrive so this was an interim phone. I would have gladly just stuck with the 5S and waited if I had known how much of a joke this expensive phone was.|on July 27, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2569|Simply powerful and awesome. Another world from s3. Powerful processor. Sharp camera image for photos I imported in on cloud and memory card but not highly impressed with first few photos I took with this camera the delay from pushing button and photo being taken is too long. Finger print security totally works for me....followed instructions and swipe full pad.S5  doesn'the have a great speaker phone. Some Samsung apps that were on S3 and Note2 are not here. Do not like chrome as much as Internet Explorer and can't install on phone. Can't read documents as well as on Note 2...Note 2 allows more enlarging than s5 . Note 2 doesn't have great phone clarity though. Note 2 is great mini tablet while S5 is a great phone.  So everything isn't perfect but I really love how powerful this phone is from my dead s3.

2578|If you were a droid RAZR HD user or Droid Razr Maxx user there you will not be totally happy with the phone'performance. Pros 1.it has a very nice amoled screen.it has a lot of different apps you may or may not use. It has a very good camera. it has the replaceable battery rather than one that is locked into the unit.the battery life isn't bad but not great considering the type of battery the razor's did. Cons 1.let's just face it if you're going to work with the phone most of the day you're going to be recharging this one before the day is out.  No  really useful functional apps. I consider it hypersensitive to touch.  It has a kind of disorganized way of the locating applications that you might want to use. With a speaker on the back of the phone, I think this makes voice recognition problematic.   All in all I just consider this phone an average regular smartphone nothing really special or unique about it. Would I buy another one...no not really and I'm not sure if I would recommend one of these to my friends.|on July 23, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2579|My first Android phone and I am satisfied with one notable exception. I am a 7 year iPhone user. Switching to Android took some adjustments but I am happy to say that Galaxy S5 is better than my iPhone 5 in many aspects, but not quite as good in two aspects. What I like about Android is that it is flexible. Android is open source so each manufacturer can make adjustments to the generic Android OS. With the S5, Samsung has made Android little more useful than the generic version. Samsung has introduced many in-house software for photos, phone, emails, and texts. The result is some very useful features such as regularly updating the local weather and showing it on the front screen, dual zone international clock, quick location/wifi/blutooth on/off switches etc. What I really like about this phone are two things: the screen and the battery life. The screen is simply stunning with colors that really pop out. It is full HD (1080p) and even the smallest icons show their details. All games come fully to life. The battery on this phone with regular use lasts me around 36 hours. That is about 12 hours more than what I get out of iPhone 5 with comparable usage. I initially had some reservations about the size of this phone. I am happy to say this phone is not too big. But I wouldn't want my phone to be any bigger or else I would need to buy pants with bigger pockets. What I don't like about this phone are two things: mediocre image stabilization in its camera and the clunky music player. I took several pictures with this phone and few images came out blurry. Sometimes I took repeated photos and they still came out blurry. Plus, the pictures came out fairly grainy. In my opinion, the camera on S5, especially its image stabilization, is not as good as the one found on iPhone 5 and 5S.  I also did not like the music player. The iPhone, in my view, was designed to be a music player from its very inception. This is apparently not so true for Android. Synchronizing iTune music with Android requires separate software purchases (iSyncr for me) and is a definite downgrade from the iTune synchronization with the iPhone. Plus, my car audio does not recognize my Samsung S5 as a "USB Music Player". My iPhone 5 worked seamlessly with my car audio. I still can, however, play music on my car audio using the Samsung S5's blutooth feature. But the sound quality isn't quite good as the USB plug-in. Pros (compared to iPhone 5): 1)Awesome battery life. 36+ hours for me. 2)Awesome screen. Independent tests showed this screen to be the best ever tested (3 months ago), and I believe it. 3)5.1 inch screen is perfect and makes the phone lot more usable. Browsing the web and using apps on this phone is a superior experience to the iPhone 5. 4)Android offers lot more flexibility and adjustments to the user's preferences. 5)Performance is very snappy and significantly better than the iPhone 5. 6)It is waterproof. I have no problems taking this on water related sports such as white-water rafting. Cons (compared to iPhone 5): 1)Image stabilization of the camera is definitely a downer. I had more blurry images with this phone in 2 months than I had with my iPhone 5 in 18 months. Plus, the picture quality is not quite as good as the iPhone 5. Megapixels be damned, I would MUCH rather take pictures with the iPhone 5. 2)Music player is clunky and is incompatible with many car audio systems. Synchronizing music with iTunes can be clunky and needs an after-market software which costs around $5. Even worse, trying to play music via car audio using USB cable simply does not work for me. I can, however, use the blutooth to play music, which has an inferior sound quality. 3)Micro SD card (for extra storage) is significantly slower than internal flash drives. I am using top-of-the-line Samsung micro SD card.|on July 23, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2588|Charging port cover broke after a few months. Poor quality connection. The cover is one of the major selling points of the S5. One would think that Samsung would have put more thought into this. Also, be prepared to buy new chargers, if you like to have extras about. The charging input is not standard.|on July 21, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars
2589|Updated: Especially since Lollipop, has been progressively slower and less reliable. Lots of lag, delays, lockups, and I even have 0.23Mbs wifi until Wifi fixer puts it back tp 133Mbs. Makes me want a new phone, which I'm sure they'd like. Old: Leaps and bounds greater (and $100 bucks cheaper) than my old Galaxy S3 I hope it lasts me until whatever the "S7" will be.|on July 21, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
2590|Absolutely love this phone! Was concerned it would be too large to carry in back pocket with a case, but it's not. I did get one with a bad Sim card but after that was replaced it works fantastically! Thanks Amazon for a great deal on the phone. The people at Verizon were in love with the blue color...none had seen it before!|on July 21, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2591|My phone died and I needed a new one.  So many choices out there and I had to figure out the best one for me. I had a Samsung product before and was very happy with it so I went with this one. Also like the HTC but I drop phones and with the metal body it would be ruined.|on July 21, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2601|this is probably the greatest samsung phone so far but, I have sprint service so I will never be able to unlock the phone's full potential because of crappy service. I was duped into upgrading to this phone by sprint saying that it is a lot faster than my galaxy 3 and this phone has a better antenna than the 3 which will make my phone perform a lot faster. but if you have crappy service the phone can't perform as promised.|on July 19, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2608|I just picked up a Galaxy S5 from Sams the other day and I love it! The only thing I don't like is the navigation. I have yet to find a good navigation app. Other than that, it's fast and has a nice screen size.|on July 18, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2609|So, here's an honest review; I don't know if I got a bad unit or not, but I didn't care enough to have it replaced; I just sold it at a loss.  Let's get the obvious out of the way; the design and materials on this thing are terrible.  The camera bulges out, and if you don't put this sucker in a case, you are going to scratch up the glass.  The whole unit looks like it was designed by fisher price; perhaps I'm a bit spoiled, coming from an iPhone, but c'mon, even that fake metal ring around the phone looks cheap.  The flap for the charger takes some getting used to; start growing long nails!  But if you are willing to overlook the design, the real kicker is the touchwiz monstrosity that is preload on this phone.  If you are used to a consistent user experience, well, it got up and left the building, and brought all his friends with it.  Colors, circles, squares, ripples, oh my!  I have a pity on a fool that opens up the settings menu!  Endless sea of circle icons!  This is the most complex UI I've ever used!  But on the other hand, one might say, it has the horsepower to chew through all those layers of gummy bear UI, right?  Wrong!  Touchwiz stutters, lags, and sometimes crashes and restarts; watching Netflix heats up the phone enough for you to cook eggs on!  That brings me to another topic; battery life.  I can't relate to any of the glowing reviews on here about battery life, but the battery life on this thing lasts for 8 hours; on stand by.  Yeah, there are no rouge processes running in the background, the signal strength is OK, and yet, by 3pm, I have about 30% battery left, and when I get home, the phone is dead.  I'm now tied to a charger everywhere I go; I have one at home, at work, and 2 in the car, just in case I get stranded somewhere and one of the chargers breaks.  Also, the unit does have some physical defects, the front facing camera wasn't seated properly, and there is a small piece of plastic covering the top portion of it.  Whenever I try to do a Skype or the likes, the other person enjoys the view of my neck.  I would assume this is a defect or a phone for ugly people; I don't know!  The device also fails at basic phone functionality too; whenever I receive a call, sometimes the screen would remain dark.  I would wait 1 ring, 2 rings, 3 rings, I would tap the screen a couple of times, shake the device in a voodoo fashion, hit the power button, and then eventually the screen would turn on, and inform me that I missed the call.  Hmm...  One would think that these reasons are enough to avoid this device at all costs, but it's not over yet.  Bluetooth stack on this thing was probably written by a 6 year old; it doesn't work!  It's Snap, Crackle and Pop all the way to the magic forest, with occasional Bluetooth crash here and there.  At first I though it was incompatibility, but then I realized, it's the same with any Bluetooth device.  It made Bluetooth audio useless with this device!  I couldn’t list to music in the car, in the house; my only other option was to run an audio wire, circa 1970’s.  The speakerphone is on the back of the phone and is tinny; crank it up during a conference call, and it starts to crackle.  But it’s not all gloom and doom; perhaps a device can be forgiven for all its innumerable flaws, once you gaze upon the gorgeous AMOLED screen!  It is truly a sight to see, no doubt about it.  This is perhaps, the only advantage that this phone has going for it; this, and the camera.  It does take good-looking shots, whether indoors or out, so you aren’t going to be disappointed by the pictures you take.  Overall, it’s hard to recommend this device over something like an iPhone, or an HTC One; heck even Xperia Z2 is eons ahead of Samsung!  If it weren’t for that screen, this phone would have flopped!|on July 18, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

2612|The Galaxy S5 is a good phone, but I'll never buy another Samsung product. About 4 months after I bought it, the charger quit working. I called Samsung for a warranty replacement. I have registered the phone with Samsung, but the agent didn't have the information, so I had to end the call, remove the battery, and find the IMEI number in tiny script (magnifying glass). After putting me on hold for a couple minutes, she told me that I would have to send the charger to them with the receipt. They would evaluate it to be sure there was no damage, and then send me another. This would take up to 11 days. Happily, I have the charger from my previous phone. If I didn't, my phone would be useless for that time without a charger. Looks like Samsung's main concern is that I might be ripping them off.|on July 17, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars

2620|Although I purchased this item from the AT&T store, I am a frequent here on Amazon and thought I would leave a quick line. I love the Galaxy S5. It has an amazingly fast processor at 2.5gz, it has 2GB of RAM, and the display is amazing. The Android interface is easy to learn and before you know it, you will be tweaking the interface to fit your personal needs. The battery life is the best I have seen in a smartphone, I have difficulty running the battery down by the end of the day. It also has an ultra power saving mode that can significantly increase your battery life. Highly recommend!|on July 15, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2621|next level hardware, great purchase! :)|on July 15, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2622|Love this thing! The screen is absolutely spectacular. The colors are brilliantly amazing and clear. Watching videos on this thing is by far the best mobile video viewing experience I've had. I had an iPhone before and don't think i'll be going back. I love how this device allows you, with many different platforms, to intergrate everything you do; from your packages being delivered, calenders, S Health, Google Pictures, GMail, the list goes on. The one downside is the bluetooth module they put into their "flagship" phone is pretty weak. Considering it's Samsungs flagship device, I would've expected stellar specs across the board but the bluetooth is a bit lackluster. Another problem I have with it is that I have set all the apps and pretty much all my data as limited to Wifi only, but for some reason, the only time I get notified for updates is when I leave wifi. As much as I am over Apple and iTunes, I gotta hand it to them. The OS we beautifully simple and bug free. Unlike Samsung Andriod.|on July 15, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2623|In the past several weeks, we've used the Samsung Galaxy S5 in Black and Electric Blue as well as the HTC One M8.  The HTC audio wins hands down as does its basic appearance, but the Samsung phones are also great.  This black phone is more of a dark gray than true black and the entire case is plastic, giving it a cheaper appearance.  I love the Electric Blue color, but since all phones are protected by case covers, the rears are not visible anyway.  Unlike the HTC, this one offers a removable battery, which along with its superior camera, are why we purchased a pair of these on Verizon Wireless.  The phone arrives loaded with apps which are unnecessary and not wanted, so what we could easily remove, we did.  The Health app is used daily by my daughter, I'm not as diligent myself.  A weakness of this phone, particularly as compared to the HTC, is the rear speaker which muffles the audio while the phone is resting.  I've found that by keeping it face down, it's easier to hear.  The fingerprint security option hasn't worked well for either of us, so it's not currently being used.  Samsung uses its own power port, think of a conjoined USB with a smaller twin port, the same as the Samsung tablet.  In general, this is a really good phone which I expect will last the two years of our contract.|on July 15, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2624|We have had a couple Samsung Galaxy S5 phones for nearly a month now, and mine has grown on me.  I'm using the Electric Blue on Verizon Wireless and despite the blue being pretty, it is covered by the case in which I have it protected.  I recently received an HTC One M8 and find that one to be much more attractive.  The Samsung case is plastic, its biggest flaw in my opinion.  Assets over the HTC are the much better camera, keyboard which contains numerals, and removable battery.  The HTC has better audio and a more intuitive system navigation for me.  The audio on the Samsung is not great and I often do not hear notifications when the phone is placed face upright.  With the rear speaker, it's better having the rear facing upright for a clearer sound.  As with any Android phone now, it arrives with applications that are unwanted, so I've been able to clear off some but not all.  If you are interested in monitoring your steps, exercise and food intake, a very nice app is built in.  My only problem with this one is the reminders after I've not used it for a few days.  I do like the ability to check the pulse.  You have several options for locking your phone, with an interesting fingerprint option.  I've not had great luck with this, even saving two different fingerprints, so I'm not currently using it.  Battery life on this phone isn't terrible and it isn't great either.  I amusing the power saver function and like to know there is an extreme setting should I become in need of truly extending the battery life.  Samsung's power ports are their own, imagine a USB with a conjoined smaller twin.  I hesitate to recommend using a standard USB cable but really think it would also charge the phone.  It's the same port as my daughter's Samsung Galaxy tablet.  All in all, I really like the phone and think it's the best I can get right now for camera capabilities.  For audio, the HTC wins.|on July 15, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

And I can tell you this phone is more than great!! Not only is the screen bigger than the iPhone as are all of the previous Samsung phones have been but the camera is better. This phone is fast, period! I haven't had any issues with crashing or any of the other problems they were having including the battery lasting, it's like they're talking about a totally different phone. The OS runs smooth and multitasking is always easy, this is the phone for people who know phones and like to be able to do more than just talk on their phone.

2661|Major defect in phone. Headphone input has a defect and doesn't fit any headphones.  Input is too large for some reason so headphones don't work.  Have to return to Amazon and nothing can be done in the Sprint store so now I'm out of a phone for a few days since I already traded in my old phone.  Wouldn't recommend buying off of Amazon since Sprint won't help you if something goes wrong or you recieve a defected phone.  Not sure what type of phones Amazon is supplying, could be refurbished, especially since it was much cheaper than everywhere else. Although it was a huge inconvenience to go without a phone and send it back, Amazon's customer service was great and overnighted my new phone once I sent the defected one back. Didn't want to spend more time and money so decided to give them another shot. They were very helpful and didn't turn out as bad as I expected.|on July 7, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars

2677|I LOVE my smartphones. I live by them work/fun. I have had Thunderbolt, iPhones 4, iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5 was my last until I decided one day after the annual Apple Conference that I had enough of being sold a name and not enough power and features!! APPLE quietly LOST 2 customers as my wife and I switched to the SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 and have LOVED everything about it....NOTHING is lost for like with its screen to the quad core 2.5 GHZ. processor...I could list feature after feature that put me in the market for two of these beautiful smartphones...YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!|on July 2, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2678|Nice and big|on July 2, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2679|I love this phone! It great for my personal and business use. It takes great pictures!! I don't think I could have chosen a better phone.|on July 2, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2680|Purchased for my wife who evaluated several phones at the Verizon store. She had thought the S5 might be too large, but the thinness compensated for that. The display is incredibly sharp and bright, and the touch screen very smooth and responsive. It came with Android Kit Kat as the standard OS. Battery life has been good, but then it is new. Unlike competitive phones, this one allows user replacement of the battery making it easy to carry a spare. So far there has been no need.|on July 2, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2681|Pros- 1. Beautiful display. 2. Great performance. 3. Battery life has been improved. 4. Improved design. 5. Premium camera with lots of features. Cons- 1. The interface still feels cluttered. 2. A lot of bloatware and redundancy. 3. Only 16 GB of internal storage. Having used the Samsung Galaxy S5 for over a month the best description I can use for it is that is it a jack of all trades. This is a phone that does everything really, really well but it is not the best at any one thing. The phone itself is fantastic and I hope this review will help you decide whether it is right one for you. DISPLAY The Galaxy family of phones has always had very attractive displays. The Galaxy S5 is no exception. The screen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution with a pixel density of 432. This makes texts and pictures incredibly sharp. It is very useful for people that like to read a lot on their phones. No more blurry texts. But it is not the resolution that makes the display special but the fact that it is a Super AMOLED screen. What does that mean? Well Super AMOLED have very saturated colors that look beautiful. The colors look slightly unrealistic but there is no denying that they are attractive. AMOLED screens also has higher contrast than its competition. Compare a Galaxy S5 screen to an LG or HTC and you will instantly notice the difference. It really makes pictures and videos come to life. The only thing I do not like about the display is that it is not very bright. If you are under direct sunlight you have to increase the brightness all the way up in order to distinguish anything. Even then videos are very difficult to watch under sunlight. PERFORMANCE The Galaxy S5 comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and 2 GB of Ram. This phone comes with latest version of android which is Kit Kat 4.4.2. This is the most secure, stable, and smooth version of android. The processor makes the phone feel fast and the phone can handle just about everything that you throw at it. With this phone you don’t have to worry about how many applications you have opened or whether or not it is going to freeze. Samsung has been refining and perfecting multitasking the last few years. In the S5 you can run two applications at the same time without any lag or stutters. I have 4 home screens with 5 widgets running at the same time and I still can’t get this phone to lag. As far as gaming is concerned, you can be confident that this phone can handle any game available in the Play Store right now without any problem. Games load fast and the performance is very smooth. I have absolutely no complains about performance. DESIGN The Galaxy S5 is made of plastic. There is no way around that. However, the back texture of the phone is much better than the one found on the S4, S3, and S2. Those phones were fingerprint magnets. After a few minutes of use without a case they would become an oily mess. That is not the case with the S5. The S5 does not collect fingerprint. The back of the device has a dimple texture that has grown on me. I am not a huge fan of the color selection of the phone but the navy blue model looks great. The phone has a 5.1 inch display. The phone is pretty big. One handed use is not impossible but it is hard. I am a fan of the fingerprint scanner on the S5. What I don’t like is the fact that you have to slide your finger in order to scan your finger. The IPhone 5S version of the fingerprint sensor is much more convenient when you are using the phone with one hand. The phone itself is comfortable to hold for long periods of time and it provides a pretty good grip. I am using the phone without a case and I don’t fear dropping the phone. I was using an LG G2 a few months ago and I was terrified of holding it without a case. It was much more slippery. Another improvement the S5 has over the S4 is that it is now water and dust resistant. The back plate has a thin rubber border on the inside that prevents water from coming in. Now the phone is NOT water proof. It will with stand the occasional water splash and maybe the unfortunate drop on the toilet. But don’t go in the pool or the beach with it. Water will eventually go in and ruin the phone. On the back of the phone below the camera there is also a heartbeat monitor. Personally I do not like it simply because it is not practical. You have to be standing really still and on a quiet environment for it to work properly. That is not exactly ideal when you are trying to use while jogging. However, when it is use properly under the right conditions I found it to be very accurate. It is a shame it is so nitpicky when it comes to its terms of use. Overall, I am happy with the design and hardware improvements. USER INTERFACE AND APPS Like I mentioned before the S5 is running android 4.4.2 Kit Kat. However, in order to differentiate their phones from other android offerings they are running a layer on top of android called Touch Wiz. As a whole Touch Wiz is a mixed bag. I like what they do with the notification area. They have many shortcut toggles on the notification area that allows for easy access to the main connections settings such as Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS, Data and more. They allow you to customize the order of the toggles as well as add or remove some of them. Where Touch Wiz gets a bit confusing is in the settings menu. For some reason, Samsung decided to have the menu settings laid out as colored bubble toggles in the setting menu. The toggles color scheme follow no discernable pattern. Even though the toggles are grouped by categories it feels disorganized. Fortunately, they decided to include a search bar at the top that lets you easily find the setting you are looking for. It reminds me of the search bar on Windows 8. It really is useful for beginners. Samsung includes a lot of their apps along with their phones. Most of the app offered by Samsung are redundant and generally inferior versions of apps found on the Google Play Store. For example, they include a virtual assistant called S Voice that is supposed to help you schedule appointments, search for the weather and look up web searches. Unfortunately, it is very slow and half the time I did not get the desired results. Google offers Google Now which is much faster and delivers better results. Each carrier comes with their own suite of apps. Most of them are useless and take up a lot of space on the hard drive. The Verizon model is specially the worst. Fortunately, you can disable most of them and install your preferred choice of apps. CAMERA The S5 comes with at 16 megapixel camera on the back and a 2.1 megapixel on the front. I do not use the front camera very often but the back camera I use every day. For taking pictures it is simply fantastic. I really like it. The camera focuses really fast and come out looking very sharp. You will get the occasional blurry picture but they are few and far in between. Night shots take a little more time to focus and there is a higher chance of getting blurry pictures. The HTC One(M8) takes better night pictures than the S5 but the S5 camera takes much better daylight pictures. I have tried both phones and for general usage the camera on the S5 is considerably better. One of the things I really like about the camera is the HDR mode. You know how sometimes when you take a picture and the subjects are standing in front of a lot of sunlight and the faces tend to come out darker than you want them to. Well when you activate HDR mode the camera takes several pictures at the same time with different exposures. It then combines them all together and highlights the best part of each photo. It makes a big difference. Now, many phones have HDR mode but in most of them you have to take the picture and then once it is done you have to go back on the gallery and check how the picture came out and see if you like it. On the S5 however, when you activate HDR mode it automatically shows you a preview on the screen of how the picture will come out. It is the first phone I have seen do it and I really like it. The Galaxy S5 has the ability to take videos in 4K resolution. The videos come out looking sharp. Unfortunately, the S5 does not have optical image stabilization. That means that videos come out looking very shaky. You really have to slow and have a steady hand if you want the video to not shake as much. This is one area where the LG G2 is considerably better than the S5 thanks to the image stabilization. The G2 videos still shake if you are not careful but not nearly as much. The image stabilization didn’t make nearly as big a difference when it came to pictures though. They are both good camera phones. BATTERY LIFE The Samsung Galaxy S5 comes with a removable 2800 mah battery. The usage is going to vary between people but for my regular day I found the batter life to be more than adequate. The thing I noticed that drained the battery quicker was the web browser. It lasts a surprisingly good time when it comes to videos though. You will appreciate this if you like streaming Netflix and YouTube. On a regular day I make about half an hour worth of calls, send about 50 texts along with an hour or so of web browsing. I usually go to sleep with the battery at about 40%. Not bad at all. I charge it every day for good measure. The phone takes between 90 to 120 minutes to charge depending on whether you are using it or not at the time. A new addition to the S5 is “Ultra Power Saving Mode”. What it basically does it strips your smartphone of everything that makes it “smart”. It is meant to be used when your battery is about to run out and it will basically only let you send texts, makes calls and use a total of six apps. The screen will also turn white and black to conserve more power. It is meant as a desperate last resort strategy. Hopefully you won’t have to use it often. STORAGE The standard version of the Galaxy S5 comes with 16 GB of internal storage. However, there is only about 10 GB of those available for you to use out of the box. The rest is taken up by the operating system and the apps that come pre-installed. Fortunately, the S5 supports the use of MicroSD cards up to 128 GB. That is great feature because you can use an MicroSD card to store your pictures and videos and use the internal storage to install apps from the Play Store. CONCLUSION Do I recommend this premium smartphone? In all honesty I do. It has a fantastic screen, smooth performance, and a very nice camera. The exterior design of the phone has been improved considerably from the S4. You will probably appreciate the addition of the fingerprint sensor and water resistant features. The heart rate monitor is not perfect but it works under the right conditions. I would have liked to have 32 GB of internal storage as opposed to 16 GB on the base model. Optical Image Stabilization would be a nice addition in the future. Overall the phone is feature packed and very complete. Samsung has proven to build pretty solid and reliable phones and they usually support software updates for at least a couple of years. I really thing that this phone is a great choice that you will like. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars.|on June 30, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

STORAGE The standard version of the Galaxy S5 comes with 16 GB of internal storage. However, there is only about 10 GB of those available for you to use out of the box. The rest is taken up by the operating system and the apps that come pre-installed. Fortunately, the S5 supports the use of MicroSD cards up to 128 GB. That is great feature because you can use an MicroSD card to store your pictures and videos and use the internal storage to install apps from the Play Store. CONCLUSION Do I recommend this premium smartphone? In all honesty I do. It has a fantastic screen, smooth performance, and a very nice camera. The exterior design of the phone has been improved considerably from the S4. You will probably appreciate the addition of the fingerprint sensor and water resistant features. The heart rate monitor is not perfect but it works under the right conditions. I would have liked to have 32 GB of internal storage as opposed to 16 GB on the base model. Optical Image Stabilization would be a nice addition in the future. Overall the phone is feature packed and very complete. Samsung has proven to build pretty solid and reliable phones and they usually support software updates for at least a couple of years. I really thing that this phone is a great choice that you will like. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars.|on June 30, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2684|Pros- 1. Beautiful display. 2. Great performance. 3. Battery life has been improved. 4. Improved design. 5. Premium camera with lots of features. Cons- 1. The interface still feels cluttered. 2. A lot of bloatware and redundancy. 3. Only 16 GB of internal storage. Having used the Samsung Galaxy S5 for over a month the best description I can use for it is that is it a jack of all trades. This is a phone that does everything really, really well but it is not the best at any one thing. The phone itself is fantastic and I hope this review will help you decide whether it is right one for you. DISPLAY The Galaxy family of phones has always had very attractive displays. The Galaxy S5 is no exception. The screen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution with a pixel density of 432. This makes texts and pictures incredibly sharp. It is very useful for people that like to read a lot on their phones. No more blurry texts. But it is not the resolution that makes the display special but the fact that it is a Super AMOLED screen. What does that mean? Well Super AMOLED have very saturated colors that look beautiful. The colors look slightly unrealistic but there is no denying that they are attractive. AMOLED screens also has higher contrast than its competition. Compare a Galaxy S5 screen to an LG or HTC and you will instantly notice the difference. It really makes pictures and videos come to life. The only thing I do not like about the display is that it is not very bright. If you are under direct sunlight you have to increase the brightness all the way up in order to distinguish anything. Even then videos are very difficult to watch under sunlight. PERFORMANCE The Galaxy S5 comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and 2 GB of Ram. This phone comes with latest version of android which is Kit Kat 4.4.2. This is the most secure, stable, and smooth version of android. The processor makes the phone feel fast and the phone can handle just about everything that you throw at it. With this phone you don’t have to worry about how many applications you have opened or whether or not it is going to freeze. Samsung has been refining and perfecting multitasking the last few years. In the S5 you can run two applications at the same time without any lag or stutters. I have 4 home screens with 5 widgets running at the same time and I still can’t get this phone to lag. As far as gaming is concerned, you can be confident that this phone can handle any game available in the Play Store right now without any problem. Games load fast and the performance is very smooth. I have absolutely no complains about performance. DESIGN The Galaxy S5 is made of plastic. There is no way around that. However, the back texture of the phone is much better than the one found on the S4, S3, and S2. Those phones were fingerprint magnets. After a few minutes of use without a case they would become an oily mess. That is not the case with the S5. The S5 does not collect fingerprint. The back of the device has a dimple texture that has grown on me. I am not a huge fan of the color selection of the phone but the navy blue model looks great. The phone has a 5.1 inch display. The phone is pretty big. One handed use is not impossible but it is hard. I am a fan of the fingerprint scanner on the S5. What I don’t like is the fact that you have to slide your finger in order to scan your finger. The IPhone 5S version of the fingerprint sensor is much more convenient when you are using the phone with one hand. The phone itself is comfortable to hold for long periods of time and it provides a pretty good grip. I am using the phone without a case and I don’t fear dropping the phone. I was using an LG G2 a few months ago and I was terrified of holding it without a case. It was much more slippery. Another improvement the S5 has over the S4 is that it is now water and dust resistant. The back plate has a thin rubber border on the inside that prevents water from coming in. Now the phone is NOT water proof. It will with stand the occasional water splash and maybe the unfortunate drop on the toilet. But don’t go in the pool or the beach with it. Water will eventually go in and ruin the phone. On the back of the phone below the camera there is also a heartbeat monitor. Personally I do not like it simply because it is not practical. You have to be standing really still and on a quiet environment for it to work properly. That is not exactly ideal when you are trying to use while jogging. However, when it is use properly under the right conditions I found it to be very accurate. It is a shame it is so nitpicky when it comes to its terms of use. Overall, I am happy with the design and hardware improvements. USER INTERFACE AND APPS Like I mentioned before the S5 is running android 4.4.2 Kit Kat. However, in order to differentiate their phones from other android offerings they are running a layer on top of android called Touch Wiz. As a whole Touch Wiz is a mixed bag. I like what they do with the notification area. They have many shortcut toggles on the notification area that allows for easy access to the main connections settings such as Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS, Data and more. They allow you to customize the order of the toggles as well as add or remove some of them. Where Touch Wiz gets a bit confusing is in the settings menu. For some reason, Samsung decided to have the menu settings laid out as colored bubble toggles in the setting menu. The toggles color scheme follow no discernable pattern. Even though the toggles are grouped by categories it feels disorganized. Fortunately, they decided to include a search bar at the top that lets you easily find the setting you are looking for. It reminds me of the search bar on Windows 8. It really is useful for beginners. Samsung includes a lot of their apps along with their phones. Most of the app offered by Samsung are redundant and generally inferior versions of apps found on the Google Play Store. For example, they include a virtual assistant called S Voice that is supposed to help you schedule appointments, search for the weather and look up web searches. Unfortunately, it is very slow and half the time I did not get the desired results. Google offers Google Now which is much faster and delivers better results. Each carrier comes with their own suite of apps. Most of them are useless and take up a lot of space on the hard drive. The Verizon model is specially the worst. Fortunately, you can disable most of them and install your preferred choice of apps. CAMERA The S5 comes with at 16 megapixel camera on the back and a 2.1 megapixel on the front. I do not use the front camera very often but the back camera I use every day. For taking pictures it is simply fantastic. I really like it. The camera focuses really fast and come out looking very sharp. You will get the occasional blurry picture but they are few and far in between. Night shots take a little more time to focus and there is a higher chance of getting blurry pictures. The HTC One(M8) takes better night pictures than the S5 but the S5 camera takes much better daylight pictures. I have tried both phones and for general usage the camera on the S5 is considerably better. One of the things I really like about the camera is the HDR mode. You know how sometimes when you take a picture and the subjects are standing in front of a lot of sunlight and the faces tend to come out darker than you want them to. Well when you activate HDR mode the camera takes several pictures at the same time with different exposures. It then combines them all together and highlights the best part of each photo. It makes a big difference. Now, many phones have HDR mode but in most of them you have to take the picture and then once it is done you have to go back on the gallery and check how the picture came out and see if you like it. On the S5 however, when you activate HDR mode it automatically shows you a preview on the screen of how the picture will come out. It is the first phone I have seen do it and I really like it. The Galaxy S5 has the ability to take videos in 4K resolution. The videos come out looking sharp. Unfortunately, the S5 does not have optical image stabilization. That means that videos come out looking very shaky. You really have to slow and have a steady hand if you want the video to not shake as much. This is one area where the LG G2 is considerably better than the S5 thanks to the image stabilization. The G2 videos still shake if you are not careful but not nearly as much. The image stabilization didn’t make nearly as big a difference when it came to pictures though. They are both good camera phones. BATTERY LIFE The Samsung Galaxy S5 comes with a removable 2800 mah battery. The usage is going to vary between people but for my regular day I found the batter life to be more than adequate. The thing I noticed that drained the battery quicker was the web browser. It lasts a surprisingly good time when it comes to videos though. You will appreciate this if you like streaming Netflix and YouTube. On a regular day I make about half an hour worth of calls, send about 50 texts along with an hour or so of web browsing. I usually go to sleep with the battery at about 40%. Not bad at all. I charge it every day for good measure. The phone takes between 90 to 120 minutes to charge depending on whether you are using it or not at the time. A new addition to the S5 is “Ultra Power Saving Mode”. What it basically does it strips your smartphone of everything that makes it “smart”. It is meant to be used when your battery is about to run out and it will basically only let you send texts, makes calls and use a total of six apps. The screen will also turn white and black to conserve more power. It is meant as a desperate last resort strategy. Hopefully you won’t have to use it often.

I really thing that this phone is a great choice that you will like. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars.|on June 30, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2688|I received my new phone a few weeks ago and I am impressed.  Look forward to getting to the AI&T store to have it connected and go over all the important features.  Since I have had a flip phone before, I want to be sure I know exactly what to do.|on June 30, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2689|Awesome phone. Going from a HTC Evo 4G LTE, and is awesome. Phenomenal camera, takes beautiful pictures. Always a learning curve with new phones, but not bad at all. Great deal on amazon, won't buy from a sprint store again. Got one for my husband too. He loves it at well.|on June 30, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2690|This phone is amazing,  I love everything about it. I was also hesitant about buying a phone from someone other than sprint,  but no worries,  it was perfectly fine! ! I even took it to the sprint store and they helped me set it up. I so recommend this phone and getting it on amazon cheaper was awesome! !|on June 30, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2691|I was a satisfied user of the iPhone 5 and 4S. Both served me well and were great performers for the technology of their time. Those phones are not in the same class as the Galaxy S5. If Apple had released the larger iPhone 6 sooner, I probably would have purchased it but I am so glad I made the decision to purchase the Galaxy S5 now. Samsung has aced it with this phone. If you are switching from an iPhone, turn off iMessage on your iPhone before you activate the Galaxy S5. Otherwise, Apple will block your text messages. Also get the Samsung Smart Switch Mobile app from the Android Play Store. I used the cloud transfer from my iPhone and the process was fast and efficient. I purchased the phone at Best Buy because I wanted to hold the phone and make sure the 5.1" larger size screen would work for me. I have small hands and it has helped to have the phone in an Otterbox case so I have plenty of grip on the phone. If this is your first smartphone, you will have to have some patience learning the phone, just as you would have to do with any other smartphone. If you are a veteran, you will love the HD screen and lightning fast response. This S5 is outstanding in every category. The battery life is pretty decent, too.|on June 26, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2692|I am loving this phone so far.  Everyone wants me to throw it in some water to see if it is really water proof but I am not going to tempt fate, phone cost to much money to do that.  But the features are nice, easy to work with.  Having fun.|on June 25, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2693|You can use this as an upgrade, I called sprint and they wanted 249.00 for the phone with a $50 dollar rebate. That ould make it $199. I found it here on amazon for 99.00. Cost me 107.00 with the bogus tax we have to pay amazon now but still alot cheaper than Sprint. Yes you can keep your plan and get the phone for 99.00 bucks. Cant go wrong and I cant believe I found this!!! Great phone and it is very fast. Makes my S3 seem very slow.|on June 25, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2694|What can I say, I love this phone.  It seems to work the way it's suppose to.  I had to mess with some of the settings when I first got it so the battery would last, but once I figured out it was the google backup that was chewing through the battery it will go two days without a charge.|on June 24, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2695|Software: On its own Android performs and looks pretty good. Samsung does their absolute best to ruin it. They took Android and added lots of annoying pop ups to remind you to do things like make sure the back cover is on and the dust flap is closed. How dumb does Samsung think its users are? Samsung has also themed the phone with their round cartoon like images instead of the regular app logos, hope you like how they look because you are stuck looking at them in the menus and the homescreen too if you keep the stock launcher. Samsung did add in lots of extra features which are gimmicks at best. Their air view only works in a couple of apps and only when it decides it wants to. The one handed mode defeats the purpose of having a big screen. I haven't noticed any difference between using the download booster and keeping it off. Overall everything Samsung has done to Android has made it slower, more annoying, and in my opinion worse looking. Hardware: This is the reason I got this phone. The screen is great. It has a fast processor and enough RAM. The main thing is the water resistance. It is great to be able to wash my phone when it gets dirty, not to mention not having to worry about it getting wet in the rain or if I get pushed into a pool. Being able to supplimnet the storage with a MicroSD card is a great feature, having up to 128 gigabytes of storage available is awesome. The battery lasts all day, I can go for a couple days if I am not using it a lot and only listen to a few hours of music. The heartbeat sensor is really handy if you need to track your heart rate. The fingerprint scanner is cool, but can be defeated by thieves as easily as a passcode. It doesn't add any real security to the device.  Overall the phone feels a little light and cheap, nothing like the heavier aluminum unibody of its competitor. It does however look good. The faux metal around the edge and the textured back gives it a great look. Overall I give it 2 out of 5 straight out of the box. I had to spend a few hours rooting, debloating, and theming mine to get the garbage out and make it look and behave halfway decent. After all of that mine is 3 and a half stars, but most users won't be able or willing to do all of that.|on June 24, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

2699|I purchased this phone for both my husband and son. They are pleased with the phones. I'm glad to have purchased it from Amazon because Sprint was charging $250 per phone.|on June 24, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2700|This phone is simply amazing, but anything but simple. Screen on the phone is stunning. The 16MP pictures that it takes are highly detailed and look great. The same can be said for the 4K recording. The fingerprint scanner works fine for unlocking the phone. With the heartbeat sensor and Samsung apps like S-Health, this phone is great for fitness. I really like the IP 67 certification( which means it's dust-proof and waterproof for 30 minutes under a meter of water.). I can now take it with me to the pool or just to listen to music in the shower. The battery last for about 8 hours of continuous use. The USB 3.0 makes data transfer faster than normal phones and the battery charging takes about two hours. the size fits comfortably in the hands. For those with smaller hands, it comes with a one handed operation mode. It's slim body easily fits into the pocket. I would highly recommend this to anyone.|on June 23, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2701|Smart phones have come a long way, especially in the past two years. I upgraded from my Razr Max and am very happy so far. I've had it for over a week. One of the first things I did (and you should too) is disabled the bloatware. There's a lot of it. I also got rid of the ugly default everything. It feels fast. I like the dust flap, for now. The camera is great. Don't be a fool (like I was at first) and make sure you scroll though all the option in the camera mode! The camera took me a few days to learn. The display is sharp. Power save and extra touch sensitivity could be useful. What I don't like: The heart rate monitor. Like many other reviews, it's kinda pointless and probably adds $100 to the phone. I don't like how clunky it is to access the camera from the unlock screen. The speakers are kinda dull, why can't they be on the front? If you are a Mac user like me, you need to install "Android Safe Transfer" which is total BS. You can't preview your files like you can in the Mac UI. Also, I wish all of the hard press buttons were on the right side. I really enjoy it so far, but these little inconveniences  make it a total of 4/5 stars.|on June 23, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2702|I absolutely love this phone. I moved from a Droid 4 with the physical keyboard. I was holding out for the possible Droid 5, but came to the conclusion that it never is going to come. The old physical keyboard allowed me to type 10 times faster than  the virtual keyboard, swype or even voice to text. It has taken some getting used to not having the physical keys and the slower texting speed, but the many other features of this Galaxy S5 has by far made up for it. I recommend this phone to all of my friends.|on June 23, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2706|300 times better than an iPhone. Went on a five day float trip took hundreds of photo's and still had 30 percent battery left.|on June 22, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2707|Its thinner than I expected, which makes it light enough that holding it up to your ear isn't an annoyance. The textured back makes it easier to hold on to, so you don't drop it.  The sound quality on a call is great, and its pretty good listening to music too.  It came with a pair of headphones with a mic that also work really well for calls or music.  The phone is plenty powerful, applications are quick to respond, and the recent apps button that replaces the menu button lets you swap between recently used apps, and it happens so fast, it almost feels like multi-tasking.  Its really an amazing phone.  My only complaint, was very minor, in that I couldn't find the sd card slot.  It is right on top of the sim card slot, which makes it easy to miss.  There is an icon indicating you can put an sd card there, but before I looked it up online, I didn't even notice the icon.  Not really enough to deduct a star.|on June 22, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2708|I bought the Samsung Galaxy S5 after researching almost every phone out there. I was replacing the S2 and Wagner to stay with an Android system. It has taken me a couple of weeks  fully appreciate the size of the viewing window and just how amazing this phone truly is (changing phones is always difficult for me, lol). The download speed is super fast; the colors are vibrant; camera is great and the options to save battery life's is a nice feature especially when traveling. I did have to replace the car charger as If no longer fit my new phone but no biggie.  I am falling in love with my Galaxy S5 : ).|on June 22, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2709|I haven't had this long, but I'm really liking it, so far.  I could still make a long list of cons, but it wouldn't be as long as my list of pros. The main thing I want to concentrate on is all the dumb apps that AT&T and Samsung feel obligated to push on it's customers.  I thought Samsung was getting away from doing that years ago, but my last few phones have been Motorola's and they were much better at not pushing their apps on you. It's just frustrating, because no one wants to use an app that's poorly supported and probably won't be around long, anyway.  At least not when there's usually far greater alternatives out there.  It takes a lot of time to filter through and identify all the junk, before finally removing it, if possible at all.  The sad thing is that all the effort that goes into these apps could have been used on improving the GUI software on the phone.  There are simply things that would be easy to do, that everyone would likely enjoy, such as better notification methods. I've always been disappointed in the slow development of mobile phone software, and while it's finally gotten much better in recent years, it still has much room for improvement. Update:  That was my initial review and I know it was quite cynical.  It's been 5 weeks and I'm still sorting through all the apps, but some of Samsung's are actually pretty good.  Still too many junk apps, though. To keep this update short, I won't go through the long list of things I've fallen in love with about the Galaxy 5, along with this version of Android.  But I do want to mention that I really like the default keyboard.  I'm really missing my HDMI port and FM tuner from my Atrix 2, though (internet radio apps can be great, but they require bandwidth and don't have every radio station.)|on June 21, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2714|Sprint Spark kills simultaneous voice and data. I went back to my Note 3 because I do a lot of tethering. Pros: -The new TouchWiz interface is clean. The floating/pop up box for incoming calls is great and doesn't take up the whole screen. -The camera is very clear. As a photographer, I am happy with the camera for use in well-lit conditions. -Battery life is great. I usually get extra batteries but the Ultra Power Saving mode has got me holding off on purchasing extra batteries. -The design looks cheap. The chrome bezel looks much cheaper and rounded than on the Note 3. -The screen is bright, sharp and looks great. Cons: -Low-light camera shots are disappointing. -No camera optical image stabilization, which is becoming a standard feature in high-end smartphones. -MTP via USB 3.0 can be buggy and has its limitations. It takes a few minutes to do simple tasks like renaming folders. USB 3.0 isn't on by default and takes three extra steps. Once on, it reverts to 2.0 after four minutes. -The water-resistant cover is flimsy and gets in the way. It would be nice if they made it water-resistant like the 3.5mm plug. -The fingerprint scanner makes it easier to unlock the phone but is tricky to use. It lets you register 3 fingers with about 10 imprints on each, so you can technically register about 30 different angles for multiple fingers. I registered my thumb at different angles so it would recognize it in one swipe. Still no fingerprint shortcuts to apps, etc. -The bezels around the screen are wide, making the screen look smaller than it really is.|on June 20, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2715|I had a Droid 2 which worked ok but the buttons started sticking. This purchase has been super awesome. I didn't think I could figure out how to work it with no keyboard but Samsung has made it so easy and the technique is above and beyond my expectations. The Health Fitness and Heart Monitoring is very easy to use and amazing at the same time. I recommend this product to anyone who is even remotely thinking of purchasing one! This feedback needs an A + + button.|on June 19, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2716|This product has been exceptional! I have purchased the Droid's in the past and thought they would be the best but this item is far better than the Droid. I am so happy with my purchase and have told everyone about how great this item is. I also purchased one for my husband and he loves it!|on June 19, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2717|Played around with this phone in the store and I really loved it the touch screen is very responsive and it feels sturdy enough that if you drop the phone it wont smash into pieces and so forth. Overall I will get this phone once I have an upgrade available which is in around six months.|on June 19, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2718|Very glad for the change although with Sprint you can't talk and surf at the same time unless using WiFi which is backwards considering this is a newer model.|on June 18, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2719|I've had this phone for 2 months. When I first bought it I had my concerns about the sturdiness of the charging cover. It is held on by a tiny plastic piece which is bound to wear down and break off with daily opening and closing to charge. Well, it did break off in 2 months. This was with me being very careful because I didn't trust the cover. It is not covered under ATT warranty. I can mail my phone to Samsung for a couple weeks while they look at it and decide it'll it was my fault or not. Maybe, I would get lucky and they would fix the cover. But what's the point? To do it all over again in 2 months. I don't think so. I just want to buy a case for it that will cover the exposed charging ports (like the ones Otter makes for the Note) but I can't find one so I guess they don't make them. Ugh Also, I upgraded from the s2 when I got this phone and I expected a huge improvement in speed. But I continue to have lag with apps, freezing screens, and slow response time. And it never ants to recognize my fingerprint.  But that is probably user error. The camera is pretty nice. The sound quality is okay.  It is just an okay phone, though.|on June 18, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

2721|I had high hopes for this phone, however after 2 months of normal use I cannot recommend this phone. Today I noticed a black ring that came loose under the glass that is covering the front facing camera. I called Samsung who told me that I would have to send it to them and be without a phone for 2+ weeks and that they do not provide a loaner or replacement phone to use in the interim. They wanted me to get one from my carrier, however I use a prepaid carrier and bought the phone on amazon and therefore could not get a loaner through those means. I explained this to them and told them it was a problem with a Samsung device, not my carrier or Amazon, but Samsung still refused to be of any help despite talking to multiple people. Searching for this issue online reveals that it is not an uncommon problem with this phone. It is very frustrating that Samsung will not take care of their customers despite the fact that it was a manufacturing/design error. Luckily Amazon customer service came through for me and has been very helpful. 5 stars for Amazon customer service. 0 stars for Samsung customer service, and 1 star for the Samsung Galaxy S5.|on June 18, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2723|we had to buy another phone to keep the number we had.  Verizon said we had to return the phone to you and come and buy from them and they could fix the problem.  2 day at Verizon and a 150.00 phone and we solved the problem.  If you sell their stuff get their techs to work with us|on June 18, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars
2724|Overall the phone is ok, but in the end it is doing the same thing my Galaxy S2 does. There is a feature called daydream, when you charge your phone u can pick a screen saver basically, that only worked the first two charges. My phone stays on, even when on the charger. It does not even go into the lock screen mode and I don’t have any feature on for the phone to always be on. The phone does my vibrate when a text message comes in if it is on vibrate.  I had to go in the  settings to put the messages on vibrate, which ALWAYS vibrate even when my phone is on sound. This is annoying to me. Still no flash player. I really like the camera. Can’t believe they got rid of the menu button. From time to time my settings just disappear. I still hav eto charge my phone EVERYDAY! The phone is OK but not what I thought it would be.|on June 18, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2725|I have much to learn regarding this Phone, but the call quality has been superb and is actually easy to use.  The dust and water proofing was the selling point for me.  Unlike some other purchasers on here, I will not test the phone to see if the claims hold up.  LOL!!  With the protective shell that I have inserted the phone in, I am sure it will stand up to the elements!|on June 18, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2726|I just received my phone so I am learning to use all the functions. I felt the directions were very limited and wish they had included more with the device.  The graphics are very clear.  Camera takes VERY nice pictures.  It came with a charger and headset.  I chose this phone after reading many reviews and I think I am going to really like this phone.  I just received the phone so my review so far is limited to the above.|on June 17, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2727|I was worried I would miss the comfort and familiarity of my IPhone 4S, but after I got this phone my first impression was it had a way better screen size and clarity. That was just the beginning. When people ask me how I like it the first thing I show them is the back button on the bottom left next to the home button. It makes using the phone so easy and foolproof. If on a webpage you can easily move back to the previous screen and also if you are in an app you can move through it more fluidly. Another thing is you can really customize the screens with adding and organizing your apps and files to be to your preference. Makes it more personalized to your liking and personality. I'm not super impressed with the fingerprint scanner and after having it on my lock screen for a week, I went with a password instead. Overall, I love the phone and I'm still learning and figuring out all the other options that are available to me.|on June 17, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2728|After two days of owning the Galaxy S5, I quickly found that I liked my S3 more than this phone. For one thing, this phone feels bulky. I don't know if it was because I was used to the S3, but it just felt awkward and squarish to me. The HTC One M8 not only looks nicer but felt more comfortable to hold when I saw it in store. The HTC also sports front-facing speakers and has very clear sound quality, while the S5 seems muffled because its speakers are in the back (why they are in the back, I do not know). After powering the phone on and doing the initial setup, I opened up the camera. I took a couple test shots using the normal back camera, and then I tried out the front camera. To my surprise, the picture was distorted! It stretched the top and bottom parts of the frame and creates an odd, enlongated appearance. A quick google search revealed that other people are experiencing the same issue, and there seems to be no fix. For a premium, flagship smartphone, this is unacceptable. Perhaps for those who don't use the front camera this is probably not a big deal. But I couldn't stand looking at my stretched out face. Moving on to the lockscreen: Unlike the Galaxy S3, you cannot add lockscreen widgets such as Dashclock. I don't know why it was removed in this phone. The only thing you can change is the wallpaper and the unlock method. The finger print scanner leaves much to be desired. "Swipe faster." "Swipe slower." "Swipe the entire pad." are the messages that I received when trying to use it to unlock my phone. I eventually had to use my backup password. Overall, I was disappointed with the Galaxy S5. I didn't like how some features were taken out and replaced by gimmicky features such as the fingerprint scanner and the heart rate monitor. I'm in the process of exchanging it with either the HTC One M8 or the LG G3 (soon to arrive in the US).|on June 16, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

2730|This phone represents the best Samsung has to offer in hardware, and amazing integrated software from Samsung, Google (Android) and other developers. The S Fitness apps are a perfect example of the unity of hardware and software. The camera on this thing is great and has some cool features, though it is lacking in basic modifier features like light balance and shutter speed. I love the battery life on this thing, and I also love how quickly it charges when I plug it into the adapter that the phone comes with. The adapter allows use with old chargers, and a new charger that has a double part which likely speeds up charging time.|on June 15, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2731|I switched phones from a Droid Maxx on verizon's network to a Samsung S5 on At&t's network. I'll start off by saying I already really liked the Droid Maxx especially for its great battery life which the S5 just hasn't come close to. That is unless you factor in the different power saving modes  which make up a lot of ground on how long you can push your battery. There are so many new features that come with the phone that it is almost overwhelming yet at the same time it really feels like an upgrade. Many people have already gone over the specifics so I'll just give my overall opinion. The basic settings and features that come standard with the phone are fine but once you take a closer look you can see how Samsung really tried to make this phone customization for a wide range of different lifestyles. That said, there is also a bit of a learning curve to get all the settings tailored to your needs. No bugs, and no problems with the operating system. Even though there are some settings that seem gimmicky there are certain situations I can see myself using some of them; like the wave over screen setting to scroll while cooking or any time my hands are dirty, the high sensitivity touch screen setting when I'm wearing gloves in the lab, or pause video when I look away feature when I'm taking notes on a video/lecture. I wouldn't say it's a perfect phone for everybody but there are so many options and settings that you can get pretty darn close.|on June 15, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2732|Great phone love everything about it excel the claim that it is water resistant.  Dipped it under the sink after making sure that it was properly sealed up at the charge port and then cleaned it off.  Phone continued to work perfectly for a while until i opened up my camera and found it to be blurry.  Upon inspection there is water in both the lenses of the forward and backward facing lenses.  Called Samsung and they said they couldn't help. Other than that the battery life is fantastic, the screen is sharp as could be.  Love the phone and will keep it with the hope eventually this water will evaporate out!!|on June 15, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars

2734|Fast and reliable.  I upgraded from a Galaxy s2 so it was a major difference for me.  This is the first time I've purchased the "latest" phone and I'm pleased with that decision.  The Bluetooth connected easily to the Microsoft Sync in my car, though it's not compatible with the text feature (2010 model basic ford sync) - this was true with my s2 as well. Features I like have more to do with software upgrades such as the widget allowing you to track your data usage with the option to warn you of reaching your limit (if you have a limited data plan).  Similarly, it tells you which apps are using the most data allowing you to adjust your usage.  Automatic back ups to the cloud only kick on with wireless connections (smart).  Oh, and it's FAST!  Set up with my work email accounts on Microsoft exchange servers was a breeze compared to past phones too. My only gripe is the text feature in my car - I would've hoped that with so many ford cars on the road the software developers would've found a way to make that work on the android side.  I'm sure it's complicated, though.|on June 14, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

I don't know all the technical reasons, but for the time being on the S5 w/ Sprint you are not able to be on the phone and use the internet unless you are connected to WIFI.  That means no driving and using the GPS and talking to someone simultaneously.  To me that was complete garbage and reason enough to return the phone. The final straw was the fact that Sprint hasn't upgraded their towers in the STL area, so when I swapped phones I would no longer get 4G in STL.  My S3 had no problem accessing it, but this new Spark thing really screwed up my connection on the S5.  I'm sure eventually it will be fixed, but I didn't feel like paying for an upgraded phone to have diminished capabilities for who knows how long.|on June 13, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
2739|I have owned an iphone for the last 5 years and finally decided to make a switch to Samsung.  I can honestly say I'm so happy I did and will probably never go back.  I love this phone.|on June 13, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2740|Upgrading from a HTC EVO I was blown away by the options this phone has.  Sadly Sprint's hit-and-miss cell coverage in various parts of Metro Phoenix, AZ leads me to deduct one star.  I ultimately went to the GS4, as the cost for a new phone was $0.01 on Amazon, and as of the date of this review Sprint has an option to use Wifi calling; allowing the phone to text and call anytime with no restrictions if placed to domestic numbers.  I did have problems with the Samsung fit application, it kept resetting causing the memory to delete. Also the pedometer was a tad bit sensitive as the steps would creep up as I had the phone sitting on the console of my car. I can't find anything wrong with this model except to say a fool like myself would break the screen quickly, thus I bought an Otterbox Defender Series to prevent my neanderthalish ways of causing damage to the phone; specifically the large screen.|on June 12, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2742|Why the Galaxy S5 is better than my old iphone 4: -It's bigger and texting is easier, but it's not so big as to be inconvenient -has more memory for a cheaper price. I have 5 times more apps and music on the galaxy -you don't need an itunes account -the graphics are wayyyyyy better. It's like a mini HD TV (great for the netflix lovers!) -the camera is much better for videos -it's supposedly water resistant for those that accidentally drop their phones in the toilet. I know too many girls with too-tight pockets that lose their phones this way, so this is a great phone for girls or women who wear tight jeans -fingerprint password is cool -lighter Now what's annoying about it? -I don't know if I can get rid of galaxy gifts and galaxy essentials. The ad for it takes up half my background and I don't find it useful. -it's been crashing from certain apps. How does one small app crash a phone with a hell of a lot more power than the first spaceship? -you need a light on to plug the charger into the phone because the slit is tiny BE WARNED! If you are switching from iphone to android, know that imessages will still go to your old iphone, even after it's been deactivated. Anybody with an iphone that imessages you (which is btw often automatic with iphones) will send a text to your old phone and your new phone WILL NOT GET IT UNTIL THEY MAKE IT A REGULAR SMS. I activated my galaxy myself instead of going to Sprint, so maybe they would have fixed that for me. But Apple is sketchy, so be sure to ask and make sure.|on June 12, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2745|Bought the phone from verizon in april. Hing broke on door of  charger port. So to get this fixed I would have to be without a phone for 2 weeks because I would have to send back to samsung.  Told both verizon and samsung that I would like to have a replacement. Nope this was not their policy.  Can not be without phone so there for the warranty on the water and dust free is null and void.  Lots of good phones out there, just don't buy samsung.|on June 11, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars
2746|The phone is too big.  The S3 was alright, the S4 was pushing the limits but thin enough to be OK, the S5 is LARGE - its big in your hand, too big for pockets, very thick with a case on. They went too far.|on June 11, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars
2747|Have had it for a few weeks now, love it so far.  Will probably end up rooting it for a little more functionality (hand swipe for screenshot is annoying) but overall the features packed in this phone is pretty amazing.|on June 11, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2750|I upgraded from an original Droid Razr and this phone is light years better. People complain about the charging port but this phone so far is not a battery hog. I charge is every night but many nights the battery is still over 50% with moderate to heavy use. I pair this phone with the galaxy gear 2 neo and these two devices compliment each other very well. I love the health features on this phone as someone who loves tracking steps and calories. The phone is quick and the screen is beautiful. I am personally a fan of Samsung's UI and it's twist on stock android. Would recommend this phone to anyone.|on June 10, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2753|It's a great device, without a doubt.  After 2 successive HTC flagships on Sprint, I decided to join the masses with samsung.  A power user, and rom geek, I've learned that the biggest user base gets all the development attention. And accessories.  So it didn't take a lot of pondering. So far, the experience has been top notch.  Everything you would expect from the top dog.  Snappy response and a worthy platform for all that android supplies. My only whine?  Better low light photography,  please.  I don't really care if it takes a higher ISO, larger aperture, or whatever.  I'm ready for the Olympus Stylus or Yashica T4 of the Android universe to emerge!|on June 10, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2761|Have had this phone for two months. Prior to this phone, I had a Galaxy S2 since 2009. The speed of transmitting data is remarkable. Camera takes excellent close-up pictures. Have not mastered distance with photos, but haven't really worked much with the camera. I had no difficulty in setting-up the phone to meet my needs. The settings are presented differently than my past phone, but still easy to maneuver. There was one instance, I inadvertently clicked a setting that was influencing my screens. Had to call Samsung technical support. The tech was extremely kind, patient and knowledgeable. He also helped me with other "bells and whistles" that were unfamiliar to me. Probably, spent 35-40 minutes discussing my needs. I would recommend this phone on Samsung's support service alone. Other features that stand out are:  it's LONG BATTERY life; Plus, a 30% battery life lasts forever in the "ULTRA POWER-SAVING MODE".  Have not had good luck with the fingerprint scanner. Occasionally it will recognize my print, but after 5 swipes...your out. Must put in pass word. For me, just as easy to start with the password. Although I don't have a need for the "HEALTH APP., it works well. I also enjoyed the voice to note and voice to calendar. It accurately understands my speech and voice. Would certainly recommend this phone. Probably will have it for many years to come.|on May 30, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2762|Hate it! Hate it! Hate it!!!!! What a stupid design! My galaxy S5 has enough useless features to fill days of exploration yet the home button wakes the phone and there's no way to disable this feature. Every time the phone is in my pocket, the home button inadvertently depresses and wake the phone. Soon after the phone rub against my pants and get unlocked. From there to the misdeal phone numbers to the deletion of important info, the way is very short. I guess it's okay, it only cost $700... I contacted Samsung but they had no help to offer other that going around it by putting a number or pattern lock on the phone. Surly my pants pocket isn't that smart. It's okay for the phone to heat up in my pants and waste battery while the screen is on. Arrgggghhhhhh! you stupid Samsung software engineers! Who the hell is testing your prototypes? We don't all wear suits like you! most of us are a blue collar working class that put our phone in our pants pocket. Please revise software to allow us to disable home button from waking phone up. And NO! I don't wan't to put a code (number, pattern, or unreliable finger print) on my phone. I don't want to see my life waste away on unlocking my phone for every time the screen goes out or with every phone call. I tried it and it suck.

2769|I do like and recommend the Galaxy S5. However, I am surprised at the missing android elements on the phone. The power save application is not sophisticated enough to be of significant use. I learned this morning, that the alarm does not work if the phone is powered off. This is a first time for me on any of my prior phones. It is the little daily things that make this "advanced" phone not so advanced.|on May 29, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

Here are some pro's and cons to get you hyped! # Screen looks AMAZING! Bright colors, bright backlight made of LED (Less power consumtion) and the colors are AMAZINGLY VIVID! # Battery Life is GREATLY improved, and can be extended FOR DAYS with the Ultra Battery Saver mode! # WATER PROOF, DUST PROOF?! YES, IT IS TRUE. I've spent 5 hours in the POURING rain at a Skrillex concert taking photos and making texts and this baby DID NOT EVEN FLINCH. Galaxy S5 is a FRICKIN BEAST!!!! # USB 3.0 Charger will make transfering songs onto your new phone FAST AS HECK! Also, HELLO?! EXPANDABLE MEMORY?! CAN I GET A 128gb OF EXTRA SPACE APPLE?! NO, NO YOU CANT! CAN I GET 128gb OF EXTRA SPACE SAMSUNG?! YES!!!! YES YOU CAN!!! # Camera? This thing takes photos so well, I use it for proffesional photography! Also, this thing can take 4k quality Videos and photos. 4K! THATS THE FUTURE BRO!!! # Games?! HECK THIS THINGS GPU IS OVER 9,000!!! YOU CAN PLAY FRIGGIN N.O.V.A. 3 WITH ZERO LAG! ZERO. LAG!!!!!! Angry Birds?! BAH! YOU ARE ONLY TOUCHING THE SURFACE BRO! # Design?! LOOKS LIKE A FRIGGIN SUPER MODEL OF THE PHONE MARKET! TAKE HER TO DINNER!!! NOW!!! # All in all?

2777|Pros: Decent camera; great shots in daylight. Not so great in lower light. It does OK sending pictures, and once you find the picture file location, it's easy to grab and copy pictures. Removable battery. External memory extension slot. Cons: (so very many) Finger swipe security feature takes several swipes, and recent (May 2014) update will not lock the phone completely for 30 seconds after 5 swipes (Previously it force a password entry). Been trying for days to find a way to back up, but no go. Backups fail, restores fail, and doesn't sync well with outlook. Sync feature will lose data from phone to Outlook on a computer, particularly Contacts. Tasks are hidden within the calendar feature, making them all but useless.  Backup will say "complete" but onlly phone log and alarm will actually back up. Samsung apps like S-Health will randomly erase all data, and apparently can't be downloaded. It takes several tries record a pulse (the sites will say, "don't press too hard" but I found I don't press hard enough). You're forced to sign up and share the data with Samsung, yet it keeps getting erased from my phone, and I can neither back it up nor restore it, despite having it set up to automatically back up every three hours. If you set up Picasa, you cannot delete pictures that have synced. Samsung's support is aggravatingly useless. The Kies software has options for synchronizing Tasks, but their support says it's not supported. Based on searching the Samsung site and other forums, along with using the Kies software, it's clear that the app isn't fully supported by Samsung itself, and they have no documentation at all, except basic "how to."  If you try to get answers from them, they'll insist on getting carrier-specific model information because the phone is supposed different for each carrier.  I have a hard time believing something so basic as Tasks is different. It will continually tell you the back cover is loose when it's clearly not. There are also multiple on=board apps for things; Samsung's brand, Google brand, and the amount of bloatware is insane. I regret buying this phone, and Samsung's responses to technical support requests have guaranteed I will not purchase another Samsung product again.|on May 25, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2779|Never thought I would use the  s health but it's awesome.  I walk 5 to 7 miles per shift at work! Battery life is not as long as I expected so I occasionally lug around the charger which is no longer micro usb. That's why it doesn't get five stars from me. You'll have to change over all your accessories to accommodate the new tip. It's super fast and the screen is without a match! Graphics are beautiful. Tried the finger print scanner but took it off almost immediately.  Needs some perfecting.  Amazon is easy to work with.

2787|After you read this review you are probably going to think the author (me) is half-crazy and I've got nobody to blame but myself. Probably true. But in my defense I am merely a consumer and a first-time Android customer. My problem is that I needed to buy an English phone that worked in China (where I live). Yeah - I could have bought the exact same phone in China, but all the menus and apps would have been in Chinese, and the app payment system would have been linked to the Chinese banking system which I, as a foreigner, don't really have access to. I was really excited about the new Samsung Galaxy S5 and thought the blue phone looked cool, so I waited and waited and waited until it was launched. Launch date arrived and at 12:01 AM I was on Amazon ready to buy (it was lunchtime in China). Nothing. Ok - yeah - there were the Galaxy S5 phones that you could buy from AT&T but they had already been posted on Amazon for weeks. Nothing had changed, and the blue phones that had been plastered all over were absolutely not available. What had happened to them? A complete mystery! This is why I think Samsung are stupid - their big "launch" was, in fact, marked only by the complete absence of any marketing activities. Apple's marketing is amazing. But what's even more amazing is that companies like Samsung can't even copy the basic things that Apple do so well. Leading up to the launch Samsung leaked information like a sieve. But after the launch Samsung eliminated all communication. The result was always going to be highly disappointed and frustrated customers! After weeks of more waiting I decided to take the plunge and buy and AT&T "no contract" white phone at the full price of $699. I didn't really want AT&T to be involved, but it seemed like it was my only option. It was, after all, a "no contract" phone. It just appeared as if Samsung couldn't distribute the phone by themselves and needed AT&T's help. My friend then hand-carried the phone over for me and placed it in my tingling hands. But the first message that popped-up on the screen was "Enter Your SIM Unlock Code". I contacted AT&T. They explained it like this: "you don't need to have a contract but you do need to have a paid AT&T service agreement". I challenged them: "but if I have a paid service agreement then that would mean that I have a contract". I went to law school so I thought it was a pretty clever argument. But I could not prevail - apparently there are legal exceptions for telecommunication monopolies. This is why I think AT&T are awful, and why I am begging you never to do business with them! But I took my half-bricked phone and persevered. I wouldn't be able to make phone calls, but at least I'd be able to play Angry Birds. Enter Google. I searched the Google Play Store in vain before finally trying to download Angry Birds from the Rovio website. But after sending me back to Google this message appeared: "This app is not available in your country". Definitely not true as I had Angry Birds on my old iPhone. So it must just be that Google sucks. Google, for reasons that are just inexplicable, do not want me to buy Angry Birds or, in fact, any app that requires a payment (yes - I was logged in with a credit card). Why, why, why? I can think of a few evil reasons but I certainly can't think of any good ones. Then, out of nowhere, Samsung start selling "international" blue phones on Amazon that are $50 cheaper than the AT&T phones. I really do hate you all!|on May 20, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars
2788|If you've done any research about the Galaxy S5 yet, you probably found at least a few people claiming that it has very few improvements from the Galaxy S4. I can honestly say that this is not the case, and that, coming from a Galaxy S4, this is probably the best decision I could have made for an upgrade. The screen alone, if not anything else, makes the product worth buying, is critically acclaimed and has been praised as the best consumer screen available by Displaymate, a long-running display reviewer. The back has also received some negative buzz; if you've ever held the first generation Nexus 7, it's very similar to that. Personally I find that it makes holding the device much easier, and combined with Samsung's build-in "One-handed Mode," the device is as convenient as ever. Ergonomically speaking, this device beats the HTC One (M8) in just about every aspect, as the M8 that I was playing with slipped out of my hands and onto the table a total of three times, at which point I had to rest it on a surface and use it like that. Samsung also included their USB 3.0 charging port on the device which comes with a special cable, but the port was made so that it can support typical Micro-USB cables as well. The camera is also out of this world, and though it takes some getting used to navigating around the different options and modes available, I think you will be impressed with how quickly it is able to focus on a subject. If you create a Samsung account, you also have other camera modes available for download from the Samsung store, some of which are somewhat gimmicky, others are pretty neat. To date, these include Animated Photo (essentially a GIF creator), Sequence shot (a slow motion viewer), Surround shot (which creates a spherical panorama), Sound & Shot (which adds a few seconds of sound to a still photo, actually kinda neat), and Sports shot (which takes pictures of fast moving objects). All of these are free, by the way, which is really cool. As of writing this review more may have been added! Using the device is super snappy and quick, and going back to my old phone I don't know how I ever survived! Only one app has ever force closed on me while using my S5, and that app was in beta so it's difficult to tell whether it was the phone or the app itself. The IR remote is also pretty cool, and the app "The Off Button" is recommended because it outputs every TV IR code in a sequence so your device can act as a universal off remote. Perfect for turning off loud TV's at the bar! I've also used it to remotely trigger my DSLR, a Pentax K-30, with the app "Camera Remote", which also works great! All in all, there's a lot to be praised about this phone, and I intend on keeping it around for a while!|on May 19, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2790|My android experience has been exclusively the Nexus series.  To which I can't say enough good things about it. With the new Galaxy, I throw a fit of rage on the very first day.  First, that annoying port cover.  Who designed a $700 computer with a flimsy port cover that is bound to break.  It's not a matter of if, it's when, and how soon. Second, the Black screen after period of inactivity.  I got this, especially if you are listening to music.  When you try to turn it back on, the entire screen goes Black.  And your only recourse is to pull off that battery, restart it again. Third, bloatware galore.  16GB of memory space, to which you you only have less <11 GB left.  The other 5-6 GB is full of crapware from Samsung, you can't even remove. I can't wait to get the next series of Nexus, then I can dump this one to the dustbin, where it truly belongs.|on May 19, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2792|The phone is great but the Sprint store gave me a hard time about getting it connected. The store was a 3rd party repair store. The phone was suppose to come ready and activated but for some reason it didn't...that is how I ended up sitting in the store for about an hour...|on May 19, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2793|I traded an iPhone 4s for the Galaxy S5 last week, and haven't regretted it for a second. It's a far better phone for far less dollars. The screen is crisp and incredible resolution. The apps load quickly and work well. There is one major flaw I have discovered, however. The camera lens is as fragile as a newborn baby. My phone slipped from the sofa to the floor, which was approximately 1.5' distance. And the lens shattered into a zillion pieces. Yes, it is glass. Yes, glass breaks. But why on earth put an extremely fragile piece of thin glass in such a vulnerable location? It's absurd. I haven't had a chance to even get a hard case for it, although I plan to find the toughest, most shock-resistant case available as soon as this lens is fixed.|on May 18, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2794|I've had my S5 for over 1 month. I love everything about it. I bought the S5 because it is the ONLY good phone out there with SD card slot and removable battery. But... I have found that battery life is so good I haven't needed to buy an extra battery. Here is the main reason I am taking the time to write this review. Last weekend I accidentally put the phone in the washer! It was in there at least 15 minutes before I fished it out. It was still on. I shut it off and put it in rice overnight, then dried it under hair dryer. Next day it started up and 100% fine!!! True story. AMAZING!  Since I paid $684 for this phone unlocked I was terrified. This phone is def waterproof as advertised. Phone is wicked fast, gorgeous screen, has latest Kit Kat Google now, I just LOVE this phone after 1 month of use.|on May 18, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2798|Of course it is a smart phone and more.  It offers extra secutity with the fingerprint feature.  It helps to watch your health and the display can be customized. Using the right cover, the S5 becomes a very fancy gaget that you will feel proud to use anywhere. It is quick, nice, and has an acceptable size.  When used with a sylus, it is even more enjoyable.|on May 17, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2799|I upgraded to the S5 from a Samsung Galaxy Nexus. The biggest improvement is battery life. It's so much better on the S5! Love all the other features that come with the phone, too, including the new OS. No complaints here!|on May 16, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2802|I used the iPhone and other Apple devices since I've used cell phones, and I always liked them. When this phone came out and it was time to conveniently upgrade, I took the plunge into the Android world. I have a Macbook Pro, Air, and an iPad Air, and was nervous about how I would like an Android and if I would be able to get used to it fast enough. A little over a month later, I am in love with this phone (and was since I turned it on). Apple's iOS gets a lot of attention for being simple and pretty, but this phone (Android) makes tasks that would take three or four actions on an iPhone take only one or two. There are more customizable features, you can delete preinstalled apps, it is faster and has a great screen on it. For me a big selling point was larger real estate on the screen. It is fantastic and is great for reading, watching sports, gaming, etc. Much preferable to the iPhone. When I hold an iPhone, it feels much smaller, and very comfortable, but I find myself missing so many features that I am now accustomed to on my GS5. There are a few cons, such as a few recurring notifications (volume control and power down) that I don't need and can't turn off, but everything else is seamless.|on May 15, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2803|THE CHARGER Please note that while the S5 has a special looking port for charging (a USB 3.0 port) you CAN use the old charger from one of your other Android powered devices!  It just happens to charge really really quickly if you use a USB 3.0 cable, but it's not necessary to do so. AMAZING SCREEN This display is nicer than any I have ever seen. It is so sharp I cannot see individual pixels with my naked eye. It's also bright, very bright! It's perfectly usable on a bright sunny day at noon without a cloud in the sky. In really bright conditions, the screen boosts the maximum allowable brightness when the auto-brightness feature enabled! So if it's extremely bright outside, leave the auto-brightness feature enabled. Unlike in previous iterations, it is superbly implemented anyway, so I'd recommend leaving it on regardless. I upgraded from the S3, and I immediately noticed the 1080P resolution, the whiter whites, darker blacks, extremely realistic and still vibrant colors, and even the capability of dimming the screen much more effectively (which is really nice when using the phone in bed).  The Super AMOLED screen seems to have been perfected in this device!  You have to see it to believe it, this is a stunningly beautiful 1080P display that knocks the competition out of the park. The size of the screen is a big plus in my opinion, as well and is especially fantastic given its... CONVENIENT MULTITASKING CAPABILITIES You can run two programs on the screen at the same time, in a split window arrangement.  The really fast processing ensures that doing so doesn't cause lags.  Even with two apps sharing the screen, the phone's operation is butter smooth.  And the 5 inch display means that you have plenty of real estate for both apps. INSANELY AWESOME ULTRA-POWER SAVING MODE This thing is for real. With 10 percent power left, you get usability the rest of the day. The S5 has a super amoled screen, so black pixels don't draw any power as opposed to back-lit LCD screens in which a black pixel is really just a pixel in which the backlight has been blocked. Ultra-power saving mode turns the screen black and white, and gives you a jet-black interface with up to six black and white icons.  This means that a tiny fraction of the pixels are powered.  This mode also reduces the screen frame rate, shuts down two of the phone's four cores, reduces in half the speed of the remaining two cores, shuts down almost all background processes, disables most apps, and sips power all the while letting you text, call, and surf the web. You can check your email via the web, but can't use the email or gmail apps. Basically it turns your phone into one of those old brick phones that lasted forever. That's pretty sweet in a pinch! At 100% power, activating ultra-power saving mode gives you 12 DAYS of standby time!  I figure with regular use I'd get a week. You could literally charge your phone to 100% before a week-long vacation, flip on ultra power-saving mode, use your phone normally (calling, texting, and some web surfing) and probably make it the entire week without having to charge it. I'd love to test that theory. But suffice it to say that gone are the days of needing to worry about a dead phone when you're out all day and don't have access to a charger. THE SECURITY OF A FINGERPRINT SCANNER It takes some getting used to, but once you set up your fingerprints, you can easily activate the phone by swiping your finger or thumb (I set mine up for one-handed use using my thumb, and after a week, it registers on the first try just about every time). No one else can access my phone and should I try and fail to unlock the phone too many times, I can then enter a password to unlock it. I had to do that a few times the first day of use. But with frequent use, I quickly learned to unlock my phone on the first attempt. I am a huge fan of the fingerprint scanner. IR BLASTER I can use the IR blaster to operate my TV. Along with Bluetooth and WiFi, the infrared blaster basically gives you the chance to make your phone a universal remote! WATER AND DUST RESISTANT I love that you could accidentally drop the phone in a puddle or have it fall out of your shirt pocket into the toilet, sink, or bathtub and you'll be just fine. It's nice that a downpour won't short-circuit your phone, and it's pretty spectacular that if you forgot to take the phone out of your pocket before doing a load of laundry, you'd likely retrieve a perfectly operable phone from the washing machine. Not sure about dust resistance, I never had a phone die from dust, but I'm guessing it's happened before and it's nice that it won't with this phone. CAMERA It's a behemoth. It's a 16 megapixel camera that takes beautiful and sharp pictures. It takes great low-light pics without the need for activating the camera flash. I used it during my Nephew's baptism recently. My aunt saw the pictures on my screen as I took them and reviewed them. After the baptism, she looked at my phone and said, "Your phone takes such beautiful pictures! I'd rather have a phone that takes pictures like that than this thing (she was holding up her really nice digital camera)! DESIGN It's functional. The S5 is made of a nice looking textured soft-feeling plastic that I think looks quite premium and is reminiscent of perforated leather (although the plastic is panned in almost every official review--I like it). Mine is white and looks fantastic, but isn't quite as soft as the black variant--which is actually a dark grey rather than black.  Nonetheless it feels nice in the hand and doesn't get as hot or cold as metal gets. It has better grip than metal, and that's important to me. You don't want to go around dropping a premium phone. And because it's flexible, the plastic cover pulls right off the back of the phone so you can replace the battery (which isn't really necessary with Ultra-power saving mode--see above), or add some extra storage with MicroSD card slot.  My only complaint design-wise is that the "chrome" side of the phone is painted plastic.  I've dropped it a few times and the chrome paint chips off very easily, and on this phone it serves a very important purpose.  The screen is slightly recessed, so the chrome takes a beating if you drop it.  It should be a durable unpainted metal that doesn't chip or scratch. THE NEGATIVE The only negative I've seen, besides the painted chrome plastic part of the phone that chips really easily, is the loudness of the speaker. It doesn't get all that loud. Some people complain about the plastic back cover.  I love it.  It's functional, grippy, and attractive. I prefer the textured plastic to just about anything else. Others actually complain about the port cover! To them I say BOO-FREAKING-HOO! Oh no, a cover that lets your phone survive a tumble through the freaking washing machine! How truly awful! THE VERDICT Ultimately the S5 looks really nice, stays alive forever (as far as modern smart phones go, anyway), can be used as a universal remote, has an incredibly bright and stunningly beautiful display that is readable in the direct light of the sun, has a fantastic camera, has a really convenient and pretty sure proof security system with the fingerprint scanning set up, can survive a tumble through the washing machine as well as lots of dust, and has a plastic design that allows for the immediate and screw-less opening of the device for the swapping of a battery or the addition of a MicroSD card! Five stars? Well, since you can't give 4.8 stars (minus 0.1 for the speaker that isn't loud enough and another 0.1 for the plastic chrome painted side that chips too easily), yep!|on May 15, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2806|I really like this phone. I was unsure about how the screen size would impact usage. Now, I cannot go back to a smaller screen. My wife has the iphone 5s, and I find myself squinting when looking at pictures (no exaggeration). The Galaxy also has a function to run the phone in a limited screen size, so that it is conducive to one-hand usage. I am impressed with the camera resolution, even though I am using it at the second worst resolution (for file size considerations). In addition, the battery has impressed me as well. While I am not using the phone, the battery very slowly discharges. and of course, it discharges at a more rapid rate under app usage.|on May 14, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2807|For most people this phone may be OK but not for me and probably other tech geeks: GOOD:  Best build quality I have seen in a phone.  Water resistant not waterproof but still very cool and it works.  After it gets dropped in water pop the back off you will see places where water will collect you will want to dry these places off.  Despite this the OEM seal on the back cover did a great job of keep water out of the vital components.  Phone is very resistant to most drop damage compared to competition.  Heat rate monitor is pretty neat and the screen is the best on any phone I have ever seen. BAD:  Samsung tried to pack a lot of technology into this phone and a lot of it does not work well.  Most if not all of the following problems are common just do a google search and you will see.  Firstly, as with a lot of locked DROID phones this one (at least the ATT model) has a bloated user interface over KitKat.  Just look at the free space on this phone vs others.  I went from a nexus5 to this phone and the difference between OS/KITKAT fluidity was night and day.  This phone is constantly locking up and hanging and at least once a day required me to remove the battery to do a hard restart.  Even the boot graphics are glitchy...really samsung? When the phone is locked sometimes the screen will no come back on when you unlock it.  The finger print lock requires you to stroke your finger at a very specific angle or it wont work. I had about only a 60% success rate after using it for about 2 weeks so I went back to a pin lock.  Camera has a really hard time focusing on really close objects and constantly hangs while taking pics and switching between picture modes sometimes locking the phone up.  KITKAT has limited the user's ability to write to an external SD card so forget about copying music to it and popping it in your media player wont be able to read the songs.  A root could easily fix this and the other issues if one were willing to forgo their phone's warranty but guess what not only is the ATT boot loader locked but it is encrypted so forget about trying to root it for now.  Such a shame too with a root I think this would be the best phone out there but no way to really tell if the phone hardware is buggy or the User Interface.  Personally I would avoid this phone it is a classic example of what looks good spec wise on paper does not always translate into how good the device is.  Very very buggy phone which is unacceptable given this is the 5th series in the samsung S line.|on May 14, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
2808|Except for the glass, I don't see anything wrong with this phone. It is an amazing phone. The glass is not made with the best Gorilla glass in the market. You will need a screen protector. Otherwise, you will crack the glass very easily. It is a very fast phone. The screen is a little bit larger than the S4. For me the phone is almost on the limit of how big a phone should be. But it is quite light. I don't consider it a bulky phone.|on May 14, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2809|Phone is hobbled by 16GB internal storage-minimum in modern phone should be 32GB. With the OS, Samsung bloat as well as carrier, you are left with about 9GB for your stuff. You will have to buy a SD card if you have any music or video. Battery life is still pretty bad for me. Dropped 5% in one hour just listening to a podcast. Headphones do not securely plugin-slightest nudge unseats them. Screen is gorgeous. Still get slight lag and delayed responsiveness to touches. Useless features added, such as heartbeat monitor(something you can do on any phone with the flash near the camera). Fingerprint scanner implementation is poor-can't use one handed, security features missing.|on May 14, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2810|This phone is frustrating.  It has top of the line specs and most all the features you could ever want in a phone.  Yet the overall experience is lacking. I bought this phone for a few reasons:  Expandable storage, optional inductive charging, and water resistance. This is the only phone on Verizon to offer all of this. Physically, this phone is light although a bit large for the screen size compared to the LG G2 and Nexus 5.  I have read this is due to the water resitance.  If so, it's a compromise I can live with.  The back of the black (dark charcoal) one is dimpled and slightly soft-touch, which I like.  The white one I looked at in the store was NOT soft touch.  I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere else.  There is a plastic chrome strip going around the outside.  Normally I don't mind chrome, but the ridged edge on the S5, combined with the plastic chrome volume and power button and dimpled back looks tacky.  There is also a door you need to pry up to access the USB port.  I don't mind because I like the water resistance and plan on getting an inductive charging back for it.  It generally looks nice, but not nearly as nice as most of its competitors.  It doesn't creak and make noise when handling as Samsungs have been known to in the past.  Online drop tests seem to indicate it is a durable design, so personally I don't really care about how "premium" it looks. I much prefer a grippy soft touch plastic to slippery metal that is prone to scratches. The home button/print scanner is a physical button rather than capacitive.  At first I didn't think I'd like it, but then I realized it also turns it on which is nice.  I still don't know if I like it, but I don't mind.  There are also capacitive back and multitask buttons along the bottom.  I do wish they weren't invisible when not lit up and swapped like on other Android phones, but I am glad they are there rather than just having on-screen buttons that take up screen space like on the Nexus 5. The screen looks nice.  Frankly, I think 1080 screens are overated and find 720 screens just as nice.  I don't hold the phone up to my nose after all.  In regular use, I don't find the resolution to be much if any improvement over my old EVO qHD screen.  Brightness and color are much better though. On to the features.  The main selling points of this phone over others seem to be the water resistance, heartrate monitor, and fingerprint scanner.  The heartrate monitor requires you to be still and quiet.  In other words, it's pretty useless and should not factor into your decision at all.  The water resistance is a great feature I think every phone should have.  I don't plan on torture testing it but there are videos online of it surviving an hour under water, a pot of boiling water, and a washing machine.  This is an important feature for me as I spend a lot of time outdoors.  The fingerprint scanner is good enough that I continue to use it.  I have both thumbs and a finger set up.  It would be nice to have one more finger available to use to cover all the ways I hold the phone.  It's a bit picky that you swipe straight down, keep contact with the button, and don't go too fast.  But once you get it down it works OK. What really lets this phone down is Samsung's TouchWiz interface.  While it offers a lot of features, some more useful than others, it is also laggy, clumsy, arguably ugly and overall just not an elegant interface.  Yes, I can use a launcher or root it or whatever, but then I'd lose the features it offers.  Two years ago that kind of thing was acceptable on Android, but I don't feel it is today. There's no getting around the lag.  I don't understand how anybody can claim it doesn't lag.  Scrolling is often not smooth.  There is a slight pause every time you select something.  All around you will find random stutters and jitters.  The camera is especially bad, often taking 6-7 seconds to snap a picture when first starting up.  This is not an Android thing as the MotoX, G2, One M8 and Nexus 5 all do not suffer from this. I wouldn't call it terrible, but it really puts a damper on the overall experience.  That's not to say this is a slow phone.  It's very fast once it does start to do something.  But there's a difference between fast and fluid. This phone is not fluid, especially compared to an iPhone or Windows Phone.  It always feels a step behind in its reactions.  If you look on forums you will find a lot of complaints about this and also a lot of "fixes" that include reducing or disabling animations.  I've done all that and it really doesn't matter. The tradeoff of course is all the features TouchWiz gives you.  There are a ton of customizations you can do to make it function just the way you want.  Oddly though, you cannot change the color scheme from the default teal and pastel.  This is the first cell phone I've owned in the past 10 years that didn't allow that, which is puzzling considering the point of something like TouchWiz is to make the phone more customizable.  It was also a bit complex getting everything setup the way I wanted.  Not very cohesive.  That could just be unfamiliarity with TouchWiz. The default email app, for whatever reason, tells you to use the Gmail app for Gmail.  I'm not sure why this is.  I setup Gmail anyway on the default app and it seems to work fine so far. The IR blaster is kind of neat but not real useful.  The "Smart Remote" to use it is lacking.  It can turn things on and off, adjust volume, and do other basic things but it's not going to replace my Harmony remote.  Or any of my remotes.  It's pretty weak and needs to be pointed almost directly at stuff to work, which is understandable when you see the size of it. The camera, once it gets around to snapping a picture, is fantastic.  Easy to use, great quality, just great all-around for a phone.  Plenty good enough to replace my old point-and-shoot Sony camera, but not my DSLR of course.  The trouble with lag seems to be worse when opening the first time in lower light situations and it can be aggravating.  I saw there is a patch to address this but I don't have it yet. All around phone funtionality is good.  Radio strength, sound quality, speed, contact functionality are all good.  Maybe not the best out there, but pretty solid.  Speaker quality is OK but not as good as some other phones.  It's good enough that I don't have trouble in the car with it.  The virtual keyboard is the best I've used.  It's accurate and does swype, predictive text, and has an extra row on top for numbers.  Contact dialing/texting is fast and easy. The S5 does support inductive charging which I plan to use.  It should come standard though and not require a new $30 cover.  The charging cover also adds a bit of bulk, so that the camera is recessed a bit rather than raised.  So if you get that some cases may not work with it. Battery life has been OK.  It makes it through a day fine with my use.  Probably average by today's standards.  There's no way for me to compare it to any other recent phone with my personal use so I won't try.  The USB3 charger charges it in about 90 minutes which is great.  What's not as great is you can't use the included USB3 cable on older microUSB devices.  You can, however, still use standard microUSB cables to charge the phone, so that's not a big deal. There are a ton of features on this phone so I won't keep going on and on.  The bottom line for me is that this phone offers the main features and functions I wanted but Samsung needs to do a lot better with the overall cohesiveness and fluidness of TouchWiz.  There's really no excuse for it with Android KitKat. As for other phones, I like the MotoX but the muddy camera was a dealbreaker.  The LG G2 was nice but water resistance and conventional buttons on the side rather than the back won out.  I didn't like the slippery metal case and on-screen buttons on the HTC One M8.  iPhone was never an option, way too small and I hate how simplistic iOS is and how closed their ecosystem is.  Nice, but not for me.  Also looked at a Nokia Icon since I love Windows RT on my Surface.  Windows Phone OS is slick and the phone is just very nice all-around.  Windows has certainly come a long ways, but it's not all the way there yet.  Things like the phone dialer and email aren't all that great.  Ultimately it was the features and Android ecosystem that Samsung won me over with.  There are just a lot of good phones out there today, which is why I give this an average rating.  I got it on sale, I probably would not have paid full (contract) price for it over a MotoX.  For a hundred dollars more it was worth it, but only because I wanted a good camera to take family pictures with.|on May 14, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2811|I've had this for about a month now. Pretty good reception compared to other sprint phones we've had. I've been happy with the battery life and it charges quickly. I've been able to take some super nice photos with the camera. fingerprint sensor always works (except when wet). I could care less about the health apps + heartbeat sensor. I only really used a few of the 'app extras' that samsung bundled in, most are like a few months free premium access and then they want you to pay for continued use. Waterproof is great - i've had people asking what phone this is, i took it to hawaii and submerged it in hot tubs and the ocean, took video underwater of fish with it. The controls are difficult or not really able to be used under water. The headphone jack did get some gravel in it + was hard to clean, and while it was drying out it kept giving me the headphone notification which was annoying. I'm not giving it a 5 star because the phone still lags at times, probably samsung's software and other apps causing it, and the chrome band around it nicks pretty easily - they could have used tougher plastic for that. You should probably still get a screen protector or cas... somehow i managed to get a decent scratch on the gorilla glass, and that would also help the dents on the rim. All in all, i really like the phone, if you're on the verge, get it.|on May 13, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2812|I'm still learning how to use this phone but so far I'm loving it. I also purchased the Logitech Pro headset to use with it,wow great pair. I haven't picked up my iPod since my purchase. I also saved over $100.00 in purchasing my phone and accessories from Amazon.|on May 13, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2813|My older husband is the Archie Bunker type,  stuck in his ways after 6 decades, not readily looking to change.  He is also REALLY attached to the physical Qwerty keyboard of his old Env3 type flip phone (Env3 in 2014? See what I mean?) especially for text messaging (usually to YELL AT ME IN ALL CAPS!) So imagine my surprise the morning the Galaxy S5 launched,  to be awakened FOUR Hours before Verizon even opens to be told WE ARE GETTING S5s. Seriously?  WE?! It's MY account.  We? I've been holding out 2.5 years for Motorola to get off its behind for the Droid 5, WE are getting S5s? Did I mention that my Archie Bunker has a partially paralyzed hand AND peripheral neuropathy? He has very limited sensation in his hands.... I'm smelling disaster.  Four whole hours. Til Verizon opens. We get breakfast.  We stalk Verizon. After the kind store manager gave us an S5 to play with for awhile,  I reluctantly ordered a black and white matched pair.  Grreat. Now I had all weekend to await the arrival of my dreamship while fear began to engulf me.  What have I done?! What am I thinking?!  We are talking about my Archie Bunker here (no!  I am most certainly NOT Edith!) The phones arrived.  We're activated. I set up his Google account and calendar (forgetting all about his stored contacts on his ancient phone...), and began hunting down the most crucial apps and laying out his desktop in an orderly fashion - Gmail, clean sweep, advanced task killer, the weather channel, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Hulu+, TED, Kindle, etc. Widgets,  can't forget those!  I also installed a screen protector and leather case.  (hint: have your technomage spouse or technogeek grandkids do this for Archie types!) It was time to turn him loose. I cringed in fear. A month has now lapsed.  I'm ready to write this review. Wow. Despite the hand issues, he has figured out ways to make the touch screen respond appropriately. He's become a regular on Facebook, even at 3am from bed! His adult kids are angered because he stopped communicating as much (note: we eventually realized the S5 shows ACCOUNT names on incoming calls,  when he sees his 'ex-wife' calling he obviously isn't answering lol!) and without that physical keyboard he's all but forgotten texting exists...  Even to reply to me. ::sigh:: But what has he learned to do?! His LinkedIn is now over 1200 connections,  he's all over Facebook day and night even from the car (passenger of course) and waiting rooms, hitting Like hours before even I see the post! He's found the camera,  our poor German Shepherd Dog now cringes at the sound of the 'shutter' click knowing that bright flash is blinding! Poor Aiko! At least Daddy hasn't yet been posting his candid furball mugs all over Facebook (that's my job!) He's so attached to his S5 it goes with him everywhere! Even to his metal desk in the basement,  which remains our cell phone black hole...  So if you experienced dead zones with other phones that likely won't change. If my knight in shining armor can survive his first month on an S5, so can yours.  I highly recommend the S5,  even for those with moderate hand disabilities.|on May 13, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2814|I absolutely LOVE my Galaxy S5!!! This is one awesome piece of scientific art!!!! Samsung definitely went to another "galaxy"!!!!|on May 12, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2815|the design is nice and sleek at the beginning the screen was freezing up.  now everything works great love it|on May 12, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2816|There are always the extremes where something (or many things) is wrong with the phone (or any product) but thankfully my phone has worked perfectly fine and I've been using it without issue. It is definitely quicker than the S3, and I really like the pictures and videos I can take with it. What I don't like is all the bloatware and space used up for things/apps I'll never use. Thankfully I have a 64GB SD card so all my music, pictures, and videos go on that since they take up the most space. I'll probably remove the bloatware once I work up the courage and knowledge to root the phone. Overall, if your phone is 2 years old or older, this is a very good upgrade that you'll easily see the improvements. If you just got your phone last year, I'd say wait for the next versions of this years phones.|on May 11, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2817|Love the new features on the S5, especially the fingerprint lock that I thought was silly before I bought this. Everything runs fast and smooth, screen is crisp and clear and adjusts to the sun better than my old Droid 3.|on May 11, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2818|The Samsung Galaxy S5 a great phone.  It is very fast.  It has an excellent batter, and I can replace it with a back up.  This phone is exactly as advertised.|on May 11, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2819|I got the S5 the other day and it's awesome! Fast, consistent and what a screen! Of course you have to turn off all the bloat-wear to get good battery life. I'm at 25% battery now after 38 hours of Light to medium use! Again, you should be savvy with Android OS to get the best use and remove or archive the bloat-wear but man, 2800 mha never felt so good! The phone feels good in your hand too. Not too big, but I have big hands. And it's light even with an Otter Box case! I really like this phone!|on May 10, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2820|I bought the S5 less than two months ago through Verizon, not Amazon.  One of the selling points is that the phone is water and dust resistant.  The USB port comes with a little flap plug attached to the phone by a rubber or plastic pin.  To charge the phone, this plug is pulled aside, then replaced after charging.  In less than two months, the plug attachment broke.  Calls to Verizon resulted in the following: They told me I needed to contact Samsung directly.  I told them that I did not buy the phone from Samsung.  They agreed to call Samsung directly while I was on hold.  When they came back on, they told that Samsung said that this problem was phone damage and not manufacturer defect.  The fix would be done at my cost.  Verizon said that they would change me $300 if I sent the phone back to them. I don't believe this dust cover is critical to the enjoyment of the phone, but it is discouraging to think that Samsung should sell a phone for $600 with such a manufacturer defect, and that Verizon refused to go to bat for a customer.|on May 9, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2821|I've been an Android user for about 4 years now, and this is the best phone I've owned. There are plenty of positive reviews that reflect what a solid phone Samsung has built. I'd like to address some of the special merits this phone has now that I've spent a couple weeks with it. *I'm upgrading from a Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, therefore I can't speak to what makes this phone different from previous versions.* 1. Expandable storage - Yes, the phone only comes with 16GB of internal storage. I use a 32GB card and have no space problems with all of my favorite apps installed. Almost all apps that I've downloaded can be moved to the card. I also use it to store photos and videos. All of my music is stored in Google's Play Music cloud. 2. Removable battery - This is a unique feature now that I find helpful. It's worth it to buy a back up battery that you keep charged for times when you don't have access to a charger or an outlet. This is especially useful for long trips. I've found that with moderate use the battery lasts about a day and a half after a full charge. 3. Disabling apps - Android phones notoriously come loaded up with software, both from the manufacturer and the carrier. Between Samsung and Verizon there are probably a dozen apps that I don't need. Samsung has a feature that allows you to disable apps you don't use. Although it doesn't remove the app from the phone, it removes it from the app drawer and prevents it from running in the background. Out of sight, out of mind for me. 4. Fingerprint scanner/heart rate monitor - Okay, these are definitely more on the gimmick side of things and not phone essentials. However, when used correctly both can be useful. I do high intensity interval training and heart rate is a major part of that. I have a Polar heart rate monitor that I use, and I found that the phone is incredibly accurate for measuring BPM by comparing results from the two. There is a companion app called S-health that allows you to keep track of diet and exercise. In an increasingly health conscious world I find that very helpful. The fingerprint scanner is a good layer of security, but make no mistake, if someone is determined to get in your phone they will find a way. It's more of a safeguard just like having a password would be. 5. Vibrant launcher (Touchwiz) with lots of customization - Having owned a few Androids the one thing that always bothered me was the "coldness" of the launchers they typically come with. This phone is very colorful and that makes my eyes happy. It's evident that Samsung put a lot of thought into the design of this phone from a software perspective. If you prefer the simplicity of pure Android you'll want to install a custom launcher (there are quite a few awesome ones for free in the Play store) or root the phone. 6. It's made of plastic - I immediately put a case on my phone so I honestly don't care what it's made out of. The hardware in this phone far outweighs the material the back cover is made from. However, if aesthetics are a huge concern for you it may not be to your tastes. 7. Battery saver - This phone has a couple power saving options. One of these options converts the phone to gray scale and severely limits the amount of processes running to prolong the battery life for days. This is a great feature for people who need their phone on, but don't want to waste battery juice when charging won't be an option for a long time. 8. Easy mode/blocking mode/private mode - Each one does vastly different things, and it speaks to the fact that Samsung is appealing to all types of users. Easy mode for people who don't want their smartphone to be TOO smart, blocking mode for turning off pesky notifications during certain times (e.g., turn off phone ringing between certain hours except for certain contacts), and private mode for securing your phone just a bit more. None of these options are on by default so if you don't want to use them, you don't have to. I really like that Samsung baked these features into the phone without making them intrusive. These aren't apps, they are settings. Those are just some of the obvious ways the phone stands out to me. I'll quickly run down a list of things that this phone has that other reviewers love as well: great camera, good battery life, big screen, fast processor, user friendly, good call quality (if anyone is actually concerned about that anymore). If you're already an Android user, this phone will not disappoint. If you're an Apple user thinking about making the switch I suggest you read the return policy (I believe Verizon gives you 15 days). It may not suit your tastes because it is a completely different operating system with a learning curve. I prefer complexity with my phones, but there's a reason iPhones are so popular - a lot of people want a phone they don't have to fiddle with at all.|on May 9, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2822|I just got this at Best Buy.  The carrier is Verizon Wireless.  The phone is really well built.  The back is easy to remove, so you can add a 128GB MicroSD card.  I added a 64GB card myself.  Then, I used a samsung application to use iTunes to write music to my Samsung S5 just like it's an iPod.  This is great.  So I'm not stuck with iPhone/iPod and iTunes.  Sound quality is excellent on my McIntosh/Sonus Faber audio system. I was worried that I would have trouble typing on the touch screen, but this has a bigger screen than iPhone, so it's much easier to type on this than it is to type on an iPhone.|on May 8, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2823|I upgraded from an S3 to an S5.  I had the S3 for several years and was very happy with it. 1) The day after I received my phone, I stopped receiving text messages completely.  I worked with the T-mobile rep to rectify it.  I had to do a hard reset on the phone.  Although I never received my missed texts, it seemed to work after that.  I was told that the phones were shipped with faulty software that Samsung was aware of.  Texts have worked fine since them. 2) The speakerphone is a half-duplex instead of full duplex.  That means that when the other person was talking or making noise on their end, they could never hear me.  I was never sure if they were hearing what i was saying or if it was actually going through.  For example, if I was talking to someone on speakerphone who was in their car and had a lot of noise on their end, they would never hear me.  As someone who uses speakerphone a lot, this is a major problem.  My Samsung S3 was full duplex.  I never had this problem. 3) My email never properly synced with my server.  If i looked at emails on my computer, they would still show as unread on my phone even AFTER I hit the sync button.  I would delete emails on my phone and after I synced, they would re-appear. 4) I would choose a specific ringtone for different friends and it would only work SOMETIMES.  One time I might get the ringtone that I specified and another time I might get my generic ringtone.  No rhyme or reason. 5) Because I live in NYC, some subway stations have cell service and others do not.  If I sent a text when I didn't have service, it SHOULD simply send when I got above ground or to a station that had service.  It wouldn't.  The text would just sit there and never send.  I would have to copy/paste it to a NEW text and send again. 6) I used the map service to find a friend who was several blocks away.  I had an address and when I put it into the phone, it sent me in the complete wrong direction.  In fact, the map started spinning as if it had no idea how to locate where I was or where I was going. 7) There was a serious lag because of Touchwiz.  It's almost as if the phone is thinking about what it needs to do. I'm being shipped a new phone but I'm not sure if it will fix ANY of these problems. If it doesn't, I'm going to have to choose a new one. Samsung REALLY rushed this one out.|on May 8, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

2829|Really was excited about the S5 and wanted to love the phone, but sadly after 10 days of use I'm thinking of returning it. My biggest complaints: 1) I use Bluetooth a lot (Big Jambox and headphones) and the S5 skips consistently with both devices. My old phone never did that. Called verizon tech support but they couldn't do anything. 2) battery life is okay, but not great.  Granted I use my phone a lot, but I expect a phone this big to have a battery that will get me through the day and this often does not.  Why can't Power Saving Mode or Ultra Power Saving Mode be enabled when the battery reaches a certain %? It has to be manually enabled? Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose? 3) the volume is low. Can barely hear folks on speaker in my car. Wish the speakers were on the front like the HTC One 4) feels too fragile and awkward for one-hand operation (even with one handed mode enabled) the good: Fast "waterproof" great screen great camera easy to use UI May give the HTC One M8 a try or the Droid Maxx|on May 7, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2830|I have been using this phone for about a month now.  My only complaint is having to deal with the waterproof usb/charge port flap for charging and usb file transfers.  The phone is built well and very fast and responsive.  The fingerprint reader, screen, cameras, pulse rate monitor and step counter all work great.  Once I have the wireless charging back and wireless charger I will be happier...|on May 7, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2831|THE CHARGER Please note that while the Samsung Galaxy S5 has a special looking port for charging (the new USB 3.0 design) it IS absolutely compatible with existing micro-USB chargers.  You CAN use the old charger from one of your old Android powered devices! Just plug it into the right side of the port, the part that looks like a micro-USB port.  It just happens to charge really really quickly if you use a USB 3.0 cable, but it's not necessary to do so. THE AMAZING SCREEN First things first, this display is nicer than any I have ever seen.  It is so sharp I cannot see individual pixels with my naked eye.  It's also bright, very bright!  It's perfectly usable on a bright sunny day at noon without a cloud in the sky.  I noted that when switching between the highest setting with and without auto-brightness, the screen actually brightened more with the auto-brightness feature enabled, but only in really bright conditions!  So if it's extremely bright outside, leave the auto-brightness feature enabled, it actually appears to be able to reach a higher brightness that way.  The auto-brightness feature is superbly implemented anyway, so I'd recommend leaving it on regardless.  I upgraded from the S3, and I immediately noticed the whiter whites, darker blacks, extremely realistic and still vibrant colors, and even the capability of dimming the screen much more effectively (which is really nice when using the phone in bed). THE INSANELY AWESOME ULTRA-POWER SAVING MODE This thing is for real.  With 10 percent power left, you get usability the rest of the day.  The S5 has a super amoled screen, so black pixels don't draw any power as opposed to back-lit LCD screens.  Ultra-power saving mode turns the screen black and white, and gives you a jet-black interface with up to six black and white icons.  It reduces the screen frame rate, shuts down two of the four cores (the phone is a quad core phone), reduces in half the speed of the remaining two cores, shuts down almost all background processes, disables most apps, and sips power all the while letting you text, call, and surf the web.  You can check your email via the web, but can't use the email or gmail apps.  Basically it turns your phone into one of those old flip phones that lasted forever.  That's pretty sweet in a pinch! You know, those moments when you're sitting at the auto-service center, sweating bullets because you're about to embark on the Ramen noodle diet for the remainder of the year?  And on top of that your phone's about to die, and all you want it to do is hang on for another few minutes so you can get the invoice and make this call: "Honey, it's the flux capacitor.  I guess a device that involves 1.21 gigawatts isn't cheap.  It's gonna be 5 gazillion dollars.  I think we're gonna be eating Ramen noodles for a while.  Can you get one of the chili flavored packs ready for me?  I'll be home in about 20 minutes.  Don't let me forget to cancel the newspaper.  That'll save us a few ... well, dear, I'm pretty sure we need the flux capacitor ... yes, I know ... but college isn't all that important these days anyway; they'll be fine ... Alright, will do.  I love you too."  At least with the S5 you don't have to worry about your phone.  It's not gonna die before you get back. Right now my phone is at 91% power.  I just activated ultra-power saving mode, and it says I'd get 11.4 DAYS of standby time.  I figure with regular use I'd get a week.  You could literally charge your phone to 100% before a week-long vacation, flip on ultra power-saving mode, use your phone normally and probably make it the entire week without having to charge it.  I'd love to test that theory.  But suffice it to say that gone are the days of needing to worry about a dead phone when you're out all day and don't have access to a charger. THE SECURITY OF A FINGERPRINT SCANNER It takes some getting used to, but once you set up your fingerprints, you can easily activate the phone by swiping your finger or thumb (I set mine up for one-handed use using my thumb, and after a week, it registers on the first try just about every time).  No one else can access my phone and should I try and fail to unlock the phone too many times, I can then enter a password to unlock it.  I had to do that a few times the first day of use.  But with frequent use, I quickly learned to unlock my phone on the first attempt.  I am a huge fan of the fingerprint scanner. THE IR BLASTER I can use the IR blaster to operate my TV.  Along with Bluetooth and WiFi, the infrared blaster basically gives you the chance to make your phone a universal remote!  Yes I use it, yes it works, yes it's another awesome feature. WATER AND DUST RESISTANT I love that you could accidentally drop the phone in a puddle or have it fall out of your shirt pocket into the toilet, sink, or bathtub and you'll be just fine.  It's nice that a downpour won't short-circuit your phone, and it's pretty spectacular that if you forgot to take the phone out of your pocket before doing a load of laundry, you'd likely retrieve a perfectly operable phone from the washing machine.  Not sure about dust resistance, I never had a phone die from dust, but I'm guessing it's happened before and it's nice that it won't with this phone. THE CAMERA It's a behemoth.  It's a 16 megapixel camera that takes beautiful and sharp pictures.  It takes great low-light pics without the need for activating the camera flash.  I used it during my Nephew's baptism recently.  My aunt saw the pictures on my screen as I took them and reviewed them.  After the baptism, she looked at my phone and said, "Your phone takes such beautiful pictures!  I'd rather have a phone that takes pictures like that than this thing (she was holding up her really nice digital camera)! THE DESIGN It's functional folks.  The S5 is made of a nice looking textured soft-feeling plastic that I think looks quite premium (although it's panned in almost every official review for being made of plastic).  Mine is white and looks fantastic, but isn't quite as soft as the black variant--which is actually a dark grey rather than black (I chose the white because it looks really good).  Nonetheless the plastic seems more scratch resistant than metal, due to its softness.  It feels nice in the hand and doesn't get hot or cold the way metal gets.  It's nice and grippy too, and that's important.  You don't want to go around dropping a premium phone.  And because it's flexible, the plastic cover pulls right off the back of the phone so you can replace the battery (which isn't really necessary with Ultra-power saving mode--see above), or add some extra storage with MicroSD card slot. THE NEGATIVE The only negative I've seen is the loudness of the speaker.  It doesn't get all that loud.  Some people complain about the plastic.  For the reasons I mentioned above, I don't.  I prefer the textured plastic to just about anything else.  Others actually complain about the port cover!  To them I say BOO-FREAKING-HOO!  Oh no, a cover that lets your phone survive a tumble through the freaking washing machine!  How truly awful! THE VERDICT Ultimately the S5 looks really nice, stays alive forever (as far as modern smart phones go, anyway), can be used as a universal remote, has an incredibly bright and stunningly beautiful display that is readable in the direct light of the sun, has a fantastic camera, has a really convenient and pretty sure proof security system with the fingerprint scanning set up, can survive a tumble through the washing machine as well as lots of dust, and has a plastic design that allows for the immediate and screw-less opening of the device for the swapping of a battery or the addition of a MicroSD card!  Five stars?  Well, since you can't give 4.9 stars (minus 0.1 for the speaker), yep!|on May 7, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2832|The phone is cool. My S3 was perfect and I would have held onto it for a lot longer if the power button hadn't gone out on me (had it a little more than 2yrs).  The only thing that has really been an upgrade for me is the quick view for texting, no need for a third party app. Other than that I don't feel like there are any major improvements or anything new that I can't live without.  The S5 is supposed to be faster but I feel it's slow when moving through emails and sometimes opening from the lock screen.  If I was waiting for this phones release and expecting something spectacular I would have been sorely disappointed.  But with that said it's a great phone, it has everything I need along with A LOT of things (pre-installed apps) that I don't. I loved my S3 so now having the S5, I'm sure I will continue to be a satisfied Galaxy user.|on May 7, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2833|First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs. With that out of the way, let's get to the point and the nitty gritty, shall we? * THE SCREEN - that is the very first thing you will notice when you look at the S5. Samsung has found its niche with AMOLED screens, which are BRIGHT & SATURATED. Everything almost literally jumps out at you, and sometimes even too much so. I had to switch to the "natural" setting, as the "vivid" and even "standard" profiles are too saturated(and FAKE) for me. It's better as a demo unit to draw you in, but for everyday use, I recommend switching to the natural profile. FACTS: The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Full HD resolution - 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~432 ppi pixel density, plus Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the screen from scratches. * The Look - the S5 has a more squared-off edges look than the S4, which is more squared off than the S3, but all three are not as angular as the S2. In terms of roundness-to square-ness, it goes from the S3 - S4 - S5 - S2 (the original S just looks like an iPhone 3GS). Check out my images for an easier comparison. The S5 is the tallest and widest, but not the thickest of the Galaxy S's. The best thing I can say about this is it's an evolution. Beauty is subjective, so judge for yourself. The front side is almost the same as any other Galaxy phone: You have the physical Home button, flanked by the "back" and "menu" capacitive buttons. Probably the most improved aspect of the design is in its functionality - it is now dust-proof, and water-proof up to 3 feet! FACTS: The dimensions are 5.59" x 2.85" x 0.32"(142cm x 72.5cm x 8.1cm), and weighs 5.11oz(145g). * The Feel - Samsung has taken a lot of flack for making the Galaxy S line so cheap looking and feeling with its plastic bodies, for being the top Android phone maker. HTC has been known to have the best craftsmanship with their all-metal One phones. Perhaps Samsung feel they are so dominant that they don't have to spend more to mass-produce metal phones, but since they don't want to come off as too arrogant, so their compromise is a dimpled, faux-rubber backside like the Nexus 7(2012) and its very own Galaxy Note 3. It definitely gives a better feel - it doesn't slip and slide in your hands or pockets anymore - but it cannot compare to the feel and craftsmanship of the HTC One(both the m7 and m8). It is on the right track though, so let's hope that rumored luxury "F" line or next year's S6 will continue to get better. * How it Runs - This phone is fast, fast, FAST! With a 2.5gHz Snapdragon 801, it has the fastest processor out there right now. It terms of real speed, I cannot say if it is faster than the HTC One m8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it is definitely up there. When you touch an app icon to launch it, it launches nearly instantly. To really see how this phone flies, just open the gallery app and scroll through all your photos and you'll see what I mean. Usually the gallery is where most phones stutter as it tries to load all your photos and albums - but NOT the S5! * The Camera - FINALLY! Samsung has decided to make a decent camera, and not just as an afterthought. This 16mp camera is really awesome, so much better than the S4. I would always get washed out images with my S3/S4/Note 2, but with the S5, it actually looks like it's from a decent point-and-shoot dedicated camera with crisp, bright, and saturated images. Low-light shooting is also vastly improved, although not as good as the new HTC One m8. 16mp means 5312 x 2988 -resolution images, so you can actually blow them up or crop them down without fearing the dreaded pixelation monster. There are a myriad of other cool and useful camera features that I will save for you to find out(like macro and "Google Street View" modes :]). And lastly, the focus is quick, quick, QUICK! Nearly instantaneous focus allows you to capture those hard-to-capture moments easier. A definitely thumbs up to Samsung for paying attention to the camera and its functions. * Software - I'm still trying to figure out everything, as there is A LOT of stuff under the hood. Samsung's TouchWiz user interface this time around is A LOT less intrusive though, as much as can be without being totally stock Android, I guess. The layout and iconography are flatter and simpler, and for the better in my view. There is also a new sensor on the back, just beneath the camera lens. It is a heart-rate monitor/pedometer, and it comes with its own health app called S Health. There is a new battery-saving mode which can save you precious minutes when you're caught in a bind. All in all, I think this version is a lot nicer-looking, more responsive, and better than the precious S phones. The ultimate question is whether this phone is a worthy upgrade over the S4. As my review title suggests, it is an evolution, an incremental upgrade over the S4. So with that said I cannot whole-heartedly recommend it if you already have a good phone, or even over the S4. But I do feel this upgrade is more vast and much better than from the S3 to the S4, so in that sense Samsung has done a much better job this year. If you are switching from an older phone that was made at least 2 years ago, then I would tell you jump right in and try the S5 - it will not disappoint you. But for those with already a good phone, and/or say you just finished year one of your 2-year contract, then I would say think hard before you make the leap. For my money, I think the Note 4 and S6 will be the bigger upgrades more worth waiting for.|on May 7, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2836|had a note 1 for two yrs - excellent phone, upgraded to a note 3....kept that for about 4 days before returning it back to at&t. Solid phone but a tad bit too large for 1 hand functionality. Now I have the S5.... Pro's: excellent display, clearer, vivid colors brighter than the note 3. ultra power saving mode, lets phone last some 8 days using basic functions. interface: smooth, very user friendly. camera: best pics I've seen taken from a phone Cons: expesnsive wouldnt consider it a "gamechanger" compared to the S4 Overall, if you're on the fence about getting a new phone or buying this one....you won't be disappointed in purchasing the S5.|on May 6, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2837|This is my first Android phone; I purchased this to replace my Windows Lumia 900, which in turn replaced my iPhone 4.  I think this is the first smartphone I have used that really sets itself apart from the competition.  The screen is large, bright, and vivid.  There is an adjustment process for new Android users, but nothing that would discourage me from recommending this phone to others.  The rear camera is very high-resolution and takes beautiful photos.  I have had the phone for a few weeks and I still discover new features and settings almost every day. In short, a great phone that should easily position itself at (or near) the top of any smartphone comparison chart.|on May 6, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2838|The blood pressure sensor is a gimmick, but that isnt why I bought it anyhow. The fingerprint scanner works better than I expected, and is reliable enough (when your hands arent covered in something) to use it to unlock the device. The fact that it is able to be used under water (in case you have a kid that likes to try to flush random things down the toilet) makes this an added bonus, not to mention it's very fast and responsive. I dont like the UI, but eh, There's an app for that, lol.|on May 5, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2840|My wife and i recently purchased the Galaxy S5 and coming from IPhone I have to say i'm on the fence about keeping them. I enjoy the ease of use of the Iphone, it makes everything simple and quick.  On the other hand i like the customization options on the Galaxy S5. I can't help feel like i'm being ripped off every time i get an IPhone. $100 for an extra 16GB of storage is crazy. An extra $100 on the Galaxy S5 would get me a 128GB Micro SD card bringing the total storage to 144GB. My biggest irritation is that there is NO AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO APP(Amazon i hope you read this!) but i don't hold that against the Galaxy S5. PROS Screen - The screen is outstanding.  Usually Super AMOLED displays are terrible in sunlight but Samsung did a great job making it work.  Everything pops and playing games and watching movies on this device is outstanding. Built Quality - Usually I would knock a phone for being plastic but it works well for this device.  The phone is very comfortable to hold and the water/dust resistance is a great bonus.  The black model looks pretty good as well. Battery - The battery life is good. On a typical day i take the phone off the charger at 5:45am and put it back on the charger around 11pm.  I do some web browsing, text messaging, push email to a Gmail and Exchange account and watch about 35 minutes of Hulu or Netflix. Also, the phone is set to auto brightness. By the time i put the phone on the charger it's at about 10%. CONS TouchWiz - TouchWiz is garbage.  I can't be any nicer about it.  Both my wife's phone and my phone have froze during phone calls. It simply just goes to a black screen and stays there. To fix the issue the battery needs to be removed for a couple seconds.  Same with the Message app.  Upon rebooting after the message app fails it tends to send the message you were trying to send at least 10 times in a row.  I would understand if the phone was rooted or it was just a third party app giving me trouble but these are core functions of the phone that aren't working correctly. In my opinion the TouchWiz skin takes a good OS and trashes it. Fingerprint Reader - The fingerprint reader is an unfinished and worthless addition to the phone.  Trying to use it one handed is a waste of time as it will only work about 10 percent of the time if you try to do a vertical one handed swipe with your thumb.  Using it with your pointer finger will give better result, maybe 60 percent success, but requires both hands. Heart rate Monitor - This is pretty much a gimmick to begin with.  It works about 75% of the time in my experience.  Probably not a deal breaker as I don't see many people ever using it. UPDATE: The freezing issues were caused by the default message app.  Having it opened caused the dialer and other apps to freeze.  Switching the default to Hangouts fixed the issue. Still not good that a core app doesn't work but i feel that Hangouts should be the default anyways.|on May 5, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2841|S5 was out of stock at purchase and stated estimated delivery at 1 month later, but shipped 1.5 weeks after purchase. The phone is very fast with minimal lag running any high resource hogging apps. The features over the S4 is minimal so not worth an upgrade, but I come from the galaxy nexus and this phone is pretty amazing upgrade. The processor and ram speed, plus the camera and camera software are the most notable improvements. Pictures have a very fast focus speed and many shooting options available. The phone is also water resistant, not going to test it out, but it does give a peace of mind knowing if I spill on it or go swimming accidentally it'll survive.|on April 27, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2843|I just got this at Best Buy.  The carrier is Verizon Wireless.  The phone is really well built.  The back is easy to remove, so you can add a 128GB MicroSD card.  I added a 64GB card myself.  Then, I used a samsung application to use iTunes to write music to my Samsung S5 just like it's an iPod.  This is great.  So I'm not stuck with iPhone/iPod and iTunes.  Sound quality is excellent on my McIntosh/Sonus Faber audio system. I was worried that I would have trouble typing on the touch screen, but this has a bigger screen than iPhone, so it's much easier to type on this than it is to type on an iPhone.|on April 27, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2844|Apps: I recently upgraded the the S5 from the S3. My S3 is running the latest version of cyanogenmod. With this in mind, I have noticed very little difference in the speed of apps compared to my S5 which is still running the stock ROM. Screen: The screen is larger but it isn't something to get worked up about. This makes the iPhone 5(any model) feel so much smaller in my hands when I play with a friend's phone. Battery: I have noticed better battery life on the S5. I have been using the same apps, checking the phone often, and leaving all wireless services on and have been able to go from 6am to midnight with only needing a short charge in the middle of the day. Fingerprint Scanner: I absolutely do not like this system that Samsung has decided to use. First, you must swipe your finger straight down and must use the entire pad. It is very awkward to do this holding the phone with one hand in a "natural" position. Fruthermore, if you have a case on your phone, it is practically impossible to use the scanner. I have a Pelican case on mine (similar to the Otterbox defender series) and can sometimes get a correct read if I use my off hand to hold the phone while the other swipes. This means the scanner is useless for me personally. IR: I really enjoy this feature! With one remote and multiple people in the house, the TV remote is often misplaced. With the IR blaster I can just sit down and not worry about trying to find the remote in the cushions. Heartbeat Monitor: This feature takes a few tries to get used to but seems to work well once you get the hang of it. You want to just lightly let your finger rest over the scanner and you should get a result every time. I have had results be as far as 10bmp off within a matter of seconds of each other. However, I would assume you are not wanting to purchase this device because you need a super accurate heart monitor. USB 3.0: USB 3.0 is amazing! The charging port on the S5? Not so much. Due to the increased water resistant capabilities, the S5 comes with a charging port cover. This cover tends to be in the way when I try to plug my phone in at night and even more so when a case is on the phone. I am also still using a micro USB charger (it is already in place and routed perfectly on my nightstand). This tends to be an issue, esspecially in the dark, as it is not always easy finding the right spot the micro charger plugs into. Once in, the phone seems to charge at the same rate as the S3. Overall: I really like this phone and do not regret this purchase even though it may seem I have nothing but complaints about it. I chose the S5 over the 5s due to OS restrictive apps that I use (such as Tasker). I chose the S5 over the M8 for a few reasons. Firstly because I have the ability to remove the back cover and change out the battery. While I have never needed to actually replace a battery on any android I have owned, I have needed to remove it on occasion when tinkering with rooting and such. Secondly, the M8 does not include Qi charging. Nor does the S5, however, there are kits you can order that will give you Qi ability underneath the back cover with the S5 (S4 and S3 as well). I have ordered one of these kits due to the charging port of the S5. The S5 is another great Samsung mobile device and I expect it should last me until my next upgrade date.|on April 27, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2845|I am in absolute love with the S5! I bought the white,  gave my husband the black. I upgraded from a Droid 4, this is his introduction to Android devices.

Fast charge time, long battery life, ease of use,  powerful,  extremely awesome camera!|on April 26, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

Its reaction time is amazing it had a fast powerup and ive been playing with the phone for about four hours now and my battery is still at 56%.

2852|....and I've had it for 2 days. I make this comparison: Droid Razr original= Ford Model T...Samsung Galaxy S5=Porshe Carrera Honestly, this phone is the smoothest, easiest operating phone I have ever owned. I like the speed of accessing anything on it, from pics, to messages, to email, it is amazingly fast and easy to use. I was afraid of the "5.1 inch" screen size but it isn't as big and cumbersome as I thought it would be.|on April 23, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2853|First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs. With that out of the way, let's get to the point and the nitty gritty, shall we? * THE SCREEN - that is the very first thing you will notice when you look at the S5. Samsung has found its niche with AMOLED screens, which are BRIGHT & SATURATED. Everything almost literally jumps out at you, and sometimes even too much so. I had to switch to the "natural" setting, as the "vivid" and even "standard" profiles are too saturated(and FAKE) for me. It's better as a demo unit to draw you in, but for everyday use, I recommend switching to the natural profile. FACTS: The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Full HD resolution - 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~432 ppi pixel density, plus Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the screen from scratches. * The Look - the S5 has a more squared-off edges look than the S4, which is more squared off than the S3, but all three are not as angular as the S2. In terms of roundness-to square-ness, it goes from the S3 - S4 - S5 - S2 (the original S just looks like an iPhone 3GS). Check out my images for an easier comparison. The S5 is the tallest and widest, but not the thickest of the Galaxy S's. The best thing I can say about this is it's an evolution. Beauty is subjective, so judge for yourself. The front side is almost the same as any other Galaxy phone: You have the physical Home button, flanked by the "back" and "menu" capacitive buttons. Probably the most improved aspect of the design is in its functionality - it is now dust-proof, and water-proof up to 3 feet! FACTS: The dimensions are 5.59" x 2.85" x 0.32"(142cm x 72.5cm x 8.1cm), and weighs 5.11oz(145g). * The Feel - Samsung has taken a lot of flack for making the Galaxy S line so cheap looking and feeling with its plastic bodies, for being the top Android phone maker. HTC has been known to have the best craftsmanship with their all-metal One phones. Perhaps Samsung feel they are so dominant that they don't have to spend more to mass-produce metal phones, but since they don't want to come off as too arrogant, so their compromise is a dimpled, faux-rubber backside like the Nexus 7(2012) and its very own Galaxy Note 3. It definitely gives a better feel - it doesn't slip and slide in your hands or pockets anymore - but it cannot compare to the feel and craftsmanship of the HTC One(both the m7 and m8). It is on the right track though, so let's hope that rumored luxury "F" line or next year's S6 will continue to get better. * How it Runs - This phone is fast, fast, FAST! With a 2.5gHz Snapdragon 801, it has the fastest processor out there right now. It terms of real speed, I cannot say if it is faster than the HTC One m8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it is definitely up there. When you touch an app icon to launch it, it launches nearly instantly. To really see how this phone flies, just open the gallery app and scroll through all your photos and you'll see what I mean. Usually the gallery is where most phones stutter as it tries to load all your photos and albums - but NOT the S5! * The Camera - FINALLY! Samsung has decided to make a decent camera, and not just as an afterthought. This 16mp camera is really awesome, so much better than the S4. I would always get washed out images with my S3/S4/Note 2, but with the S5, it actually looks like it's from a decent point-and-shoot dedicated camera with crisp, bright, and saturated images. Low-light shooting is also vastly improved, although not as good as the new HTC One m8. 16mp means 5312 x 2988 -resolution images, so you can actually blow them up or crop them down without fearing the dreaded pixelation monster. There are a myriad of other cool and useful camera features that I will save for you to find out(like macro and "Google Street View" modes :]). And lastly, the focus is quick, quick, QUICK! Nearly instantaneous focus allows you to capture those hard-to-capture moments easier. A definitely thumbs up to Samsung for paying attention to the camera and its functions. * Software - I'm still trying to figure out everything, as there is A LOT of stuff under the hood. Samsung's TouchWiz user interface this time around is A LOT less intrusive though, as much as can be without being totally stock Android, I guess. The layout and iconography are flatter and simpler, and for the better in my view. There is also a new sensor on the back, just beneath the camera lens. It is a heart-rate monitor/pedometer, and it comes with its own health app called S Health. There is a new battery-saving mode which can save you precious minutes when you're caught in a bind. All in all, I think this version is a lot nicer-looking, more responsive, and better than the precious S phones. The ultimate question is whether this phone is a worthy upgrade over the S4. As my review title suggests, it is an evolution, an incremental upgrade over the S4. So with that said I cannot whole-heartedly recommend it if you already have a good phone, or even over the S4. But I do feel this upgrade is more vast and much better than from the S3 to the S4, so in that sense Samsung has done a much better job this year. If you are switching from an older phone that was made at least 2 years ago, then I would tell you jump right in and try the S5 - it will not disappoint you. But for those with already a good phone, and/or say you just finished year one of your 2-year contract, then I would say think hard before you make the leap. For my money, I think the Note 4 and S6 will be the bigger upgrades more worth waiting for.|on April 23, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2855|I know I wont cover everything that this phone has, pro and con, so I will just explain what I've noticed. First off - the plastic. Seems like every review has a gripe with plastic as a material on this phone - Ive owned iphones (1,2,3,4s,5s), HTC's (one), and Galaxy's (SIII) - and I enjoy the feel of this phone. The back is dimpled soft, if youve seen or held a (Asus) Google Nexus 7 2012 the back is exactly the same, soft to the touch and provides great grip. The plastic sides may scratch, but honestly not as easy as a HTC with its brushed finish. When I first opened the box, I held the phone in one hand and the battery in another and couldn't figure out how, together, they would create a sufficient weight to 'feel' like a phone. You get used to it. I didn't like the riveted bezel in pictures, and while its grown on me, I still don't think aesthetically it was the best choice. The phone is IP67 which means dust and waterproof, something I have yet to voluntarily test. After a few minutes the phone felt just like it should in my hand. I can operate almost all features with one hand (6'1" / normal hands). The S5 is truly a slab of a phone, thin with an exquisite screen. The screen pops with color and is hypnotizing when you throw a good image or video on there. The camera is great, though I would highly recommend the Google official camera in the play store. The stock Samsung camera is good, but has so many options and settings a nerd like me gets too lost in technical aspects. Google camera uses the Samsung's 16 megapixel sensor beautifully - the panorama and photo-sphere modes blew everyone away at the beach. No matter the camera app you use, low light is a large problem for this sensor, and it shows in most pictures I've taken inside. The video is 4k, though I've read its not technically 4k playback, fact is, I don't have a 4k TV so it doesn't matter. The video looks good on my 23" monitors and that's good enough.The s-health app is pretty much useless with its heart rate sensor constantly unable to measure or reporting vastly different readings, and the pedometer was different than a few other fitness wearable I've compared.  Touchwiz is less bloated, but since I've used Cynogenmod 10.2 on my SIII and stock Android on my HTC I still see allot of unneeded stuff there. The reason I haven't tried to flash this S5 yet is that some of the features really are cool, like power saving mode, right now with my S5 @ 88% it estimates 11.0 days of standby time in 'Ultra Power Saving' mode. This may come in handy soon, because the screen (as gorgeous as it is) hogs the battery. Right now its using 32% of my systems battery resources and its set to about 45% brightness. The Touchwiz over Android KitKat is snappy as hell, only lag I get is with my Google Voice integration stuttering when I open the Google Voice app to text. One other thing that is trivial but worth a mention is that the USB 3.0 charger is bulky and tough to attach to your phone, you first pull off the sealed port on the S5 (b/c of waterproof) that is held on with a small piece of plastic, and to get the USB male end into the port, youve got to be firm. It does charge fast, about 2 hours to full charge from 3% for me so far. I think that the Samsung Galaxy line is truly a workhorse of a phone, and plan on having this for at least a few years.|on April 23, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2856|I am beyond impressed with this phone. Playing with the phone in the store does not give it justice. I came from an iphone 4 so this is a huge upgrade. For a short time I used the GS4 and this is the S4 on steriods. I usually find things wrong with every cell phone, but so far I love this so much and that is why I want to review this. There are so many wonderful things on this phone, but I will just share a few of my favorite things. 1. The camera is my favorite feature. With 16 mp it is extremely clear. It is wayyyyyy better than the iphone 4 I had. It is almost unbelievable. I like that you can press a button on top to take the pic rather than using the touch screen. 2. Screen Size: This is way bigger that the iphone so it is an adjustment, but I is nice to be able to see what I am doing. 3. Resolution: The bright crisp colors and resolution are very impressive 4. Snappy: This is my first 4G, but I am so happy with how quick it is. There is no lag time at all. 5: Simple to use: There was almost no learning curve, however I have used Android before. I was able to navigate very easily and find what I needed. 6. Battery Life: There is a noticeable difference. My previous phones would barely get me through the work day. This gets me through 2 whole days. There is also a feature to put it in grey scale and this will get around 6 days. Unbelievable! There are so many other features such as the TV remote, heart monitor, and much more, but I have not used every feature yet. I just wanted to highlight my favorite features. This phone continues to awe me. I honestly have no complaints. I wondered if I should just get the S4, but I am grateful that I chose the S5. You will see the difference. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a smart phone and likes a slightly bigger screen. This is great for personal and business. You will not regret it!|on April 22, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2857|I took a while to decide what phone to upgrade to. When the HTC one m8 came out I was positive that was the phone for me, I was very unimpressed with its camera. When thever s5 came out, I was disappointed in the gimmicks Samsung took with the phone. However, there are so many features on this phone that truly do improve the experience. Customizing the operating system is fantastic, and many of the internal software features come in handy often. I actually have grown to like the one handed use feature which shrinks the screen to what ever side your tub is on. Samsung does include useless other features, but they all work as advertised. The camera is fantastic, I had an 8 mp camera on my last phone and this is truly better.  Plus many of the features on the camera are fun and very useful. In deciding which phone to choose the camera was one of the most important to me and I am happy with the performance of this one. Anyone who reads this should know that buying a flagship device will most often be an improvement over previous devices. I owned a motorola Droid bionic for 2 years, it served me well, but going from that to my Shiney GS5 feels like I moved from a record player to an ipod, or a pinto to a Lamborghini,  or apartment to mansion.  If you are moving off a two year contract like I did, any flagship device will be a vast improvement,  justhe find features that are important to you and decide from there. As a side note, I'm finding the battery life is excellent,  batteries themselves have not changedone much, but management of power usage has and the gs5 manages the power exceptionally. Watching Netflix for over an hour and a half lost me about 5 percent of my battery.|on April 22, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2858|From the start this has been nothing but a hassle Amazon made us all believe that we would be getting our phone with free 2 day shipping, but we aren't.  The tracking system is down, and the shipment is ran on UPS GROUND.  My delivery date had been set for April 23rd by 8 PM (previously ordered on the 15th).  Although UPS HASNT EVEN MOVED IT, NOR HAVE THEY RECEIVED IT! If you are reading this and think however much off your getting is a deal, your mistaken.  Pay the extra money at your phone company at least you'll get it then.  The actual delivery date is now being set for Monday, this is completley unacceptable from a company like amazon, i have never had a problem like this. BTW iam not an angry apple fanboy/customer, iam switching from the 4S which is a piece of crap, to the S5 because the phone itself is a 7/5.. Unfortunately amazon has made a complete debacle out of something believed to be good.|on April 22, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2859|I've been stuck with my Droid Bionic for 3 years since my sister stole my upgrade previously, and this phone is just a night and day difference. Lightning fast, super easy to use and of course all of the wonders of Google made it extremely easy to setup. I would in every way recommend this phone to anyone in the market for a new one!|on April 22, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2860|I moved over from an iPhone 5 and had been using Apple phones since the iPhone 4 came out.  Previous to that I used an Android phone and at the time it seemed like Android was still in a building phase with the overall OS.  Now a few years later and I'm back to Android with the Samsung Galaxy S5.  I purchased mine through a Verizon store a few days ago and so far this phone rocks!  The screen by itself is well worth the move from iPhone to Android.  It's bigger, has a better picture, and works much better while outside in sunlight.  The camera also takes much better pictures than the iPhone 5 I had previously.  Video so far has also been a lot better with the 1080p quality it looks great even off the phone. The OS is responsive and so far has not shown any sluggishness.  I have had a couple of the apps the phone with crash once or twice but certainly nothing different than what I'd see on the iPhone every so often.  The size of the Galaxy S5 is taking some getting used to.  I would just slide my iPhone 5 into my back pocket most times and while I can do that still with the Galaxy S5 it is noticeably larger. I'm also taking some time to adjust to the volume controls on the Samsung Galaxy S5.  With my old iPhone 5 if you dropped the volume low all apps and such that made noise were at the same level.  I found out in a meeting at work that isn't always the case with the Galaxy S5.  A minor annoyance which I'm sure I can adjust to and figure out quickly enough. All in all so far I'm very happy with my Samsung Galaxy S5 and would recommend it to anyone thinking about a switch.|on April 21, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2861|I have been using my new S5 for a few days now and am very impressed with this device.  However I just found a flaw in its use of the fingerprint reader that I found quite disturbing and I have since verified with Samsung directly that this is the way it is designed. The issue is that if you encrypt your device all of the lock screen options go away except for password.  In other words if you want to encrypt your device the fingerprint reader is effectively disabled.  Samsung told me they would forward my concern on this to engineering but I think buyers should know about this.  If you don't intend to encrypt your phone this is not an issue and I would admit most people probably don't.  (though more should IMO)  The camera on this phone is fantastic by the way.|on April 21, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2863|As a mobile developer who uses a lot of handsets on iOS and Android, I am an iOS user as my primary device. The most difficult thing for me when using a large Android phone is that I find them slippery and relatively impossible to control with one hand. It continues to confound me why manufacturers continues to use slippery chromed plastic rather than attempting to have something which remotely allows you to retain a grip. Related to this is my constant tendency to unintentionally launch apps and/or navigate away from what I am doing while handling the phone thanks to the giant screen with then bezel, and super sensitive capacitive buttons. This hasn't changed a bit with the S5 - I even dialed 911 accidentally the first day I had it - but the performance, features, and display on this device are all so amazing I have been using it as my primary for the past week nonetheless. I also tend to get lost as to what app I am in, especially when using apps with ambiguous names and interfaces (like 'gallery' and 'photos' and Samsung and Google camera apps and editors which launch each other). Being constantly asked for default apps is seemingly a neverending dialog no matter how much I select 'always' - just give me some good defaults and let me change them in settings when I want. I really do feel that at some point, Android needs to bit the bullet and move away from the button arrangement and keep all the controls on-screen or limited to one button like iOS. That display - that display. My word. Its simply gorgeous and so high resolution, I haven't even been using my iPad lately - and I do feel that there will be a sweet spot with phablets where I will eventually not want to bother bringing my iPad mini with me, even though it is easier to do work on. Its also really weird that, although these phablets are outstanding to watch video on, there are so few solutions for propping the device up like the kickstand on the original EVO - much less included with the device. As for tech, the camera on this phone is amazing in terms of features, most notably the 60fps 1080p and 30 FPS UltraHD video modes - wow. Both modes look outstanding and work perfectly - iMovie handled the UltraHD video perfectly, although it only outputs 1080P movies. UltraHD is really hard to appreciate without a 4k display anyway - but while it may not be a very cinematic choice, 60FPS 1080P is just mind-blowingly realistic. I have also been using this with a Gear Fit and Fear 2, and the setup and interoperability has been flawless so far, despite the arguable value of the software. I might have seen my last day not wearing a smartwatch just for the convenience of not having to take out my phone so much. Sorry this isn't a proper review, but more of a stream of consciousness, but wanted to share my impressions of this very cool device.|on April 21, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2864|I've had the iPhone since day one (The ugly 2g!)  I've always been a fan of IOS but after the last few version of both IOS and Android, I have to say I'm believing there is parity.  NOTE: The AT&T phone cannot be rooted (at this point, see review date).  I didn't know this at the time of purchase.  I purchased my phone from AT&T for the full purchase price no contract. Pros: The camera is a vast improvement over the iPhone 5s, we have a toddler and taking pictures with this new phone has been great.  Faster focus, more options and better video. Galaxy S5 – 16MP, 2MP front camera iPhone 5S – 8MP, 1.2MP front camera The screen is great, I was worried about getting a phone this big but a week later, I have no regrets.  I find myself using this phone more than my tablet.  The resolution is amazing and the black levels on the phone are so much deeper than the iPhone. Galaxy S5 – 5.1" Super AMOLED, 1080 x 1920 iPhone 5S – 4" IPS LCD,1,536 x 640 I'm only highlighting the two main pros for me, there are many others but the two above were the most important factors for me. Cons: Specifically for the AT&T Version:  The phone came carrier locked even though I purchased it with no contract.  The next day, however, I was able to chat with AT&T online and the rep gave me the unlock pin and instructions so my phone is now carrier unlocked. You will need a sim from another carrier to complete this process. (I used a Verizon sim from an old phone in the office and cut it fit.  Worked like a charm) The plastic back cover of Samsung is taking some getting used to.  I don't keep my phones in cases so I'm used to the feel of the iPhone's solid construction.  Don't get me wrong the Samsung Galaxy S5's back dimpled cover does provide a good amount of grip.  If you're putting this phone into a case the the construction or rather feel of the construction shouldn't be an issue.  Also, a pro for the S5 is the waterproof rating (30 minutes at 1m)!  That is a huge plus for me. Learning a new OS took a bit, however, there are dozens of great guides on how to make the transition from IOS to Android as painless as possible.  You can get 3rd party apps to modify your desktop screens and dock to behave more like IOS if you liked the way they worked.  Also, you can get the parallax functionality of the wallpaper with another 3rd party app.|on April 20, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2865|I'll keep it short, it's a awesome phone. I upgraded from a two year old Razr Maxx enough said. I bought a nice case so the plastic cover dos'nt bother me.|on April 20, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2866|My upgrade became available just in time to get the S5. I shopped around for the best deal and pre-ordered it at a local store. I really liked the phone initially. The fingerprint scanner is a great feature. I had no problems with the response or speed of the phone. Still had some network issues with calls but, I'm use to it with Sprint. After all that, I discovered that this phone does not allow you to Talk & Surf at the same time. For the entire week, I was on a call and made several attempts to get on the internet or do something data related and I would get a "no connection" error. I thought there must be a setting I was missing, so I tried changing the networks to all that was available (CDMA, LTE/CDMA, GSM, Automatic). Each time, I would make a phone call and try the internet and it never worked. Which means, there's no Facebooking, Instagraming, Hangouts, Google Maps/Search, BBM, Twitter, GroupMe...NOTHING data related while on a call. The only time it works is when the phone is connected to a Wi-Fi zone. This was UNACCEPTABLE for me! Hence, the reason I gave it 2 stars. I upgraded from an S3 to the S5 and never had an issue with surfing the net while on a call on my S3. I Talk & Surf everyday. Apparently, this phone was developed with the new 'Spark LTE' network which does not allow Talk & Surf. You can only do one at a time due to a hardware change in the phone from dual band to single band. If you're in the middle of downloading, uploading, surfing, etc., and a call comes in, the phone will immediately cut off your data and will not resume until you end the call. I Googled this issue and it is legitimate based on Sprint Community Forums. Also, I contacted the local Sprint store and they verified this as well. Therefore, I returned the S5 before my grace period was up and got the Note 3 instead. Now, I can Talk & Surf again!! If Talk & Surf is important to you as it is to me, I suggest that you stick with the S3, S4, or the Notes. Stay away from any phone that says "Spark LTE" until Sprint fixes it.|on April 20, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
2867|I did not purchase this phone from Amazon, but I wanted to let everyone know how I rate the new Samsung S5. 1. Weight of the phone.  Its light, but not feather light.  5 of 5 stars 2. Processor Speed.  Holy cow! Smooth and fast.  There simply is no delay with any application.  5 of 5 stars 3. Music Sound with Ear Phones or buds.  Excellent bass and overall range.  If you have a good quality set of head phones or ear buds you will really enjoy this phone's MP3 capability.  5 of 5 stars. 4. Internal speaker. Its a bit quiet probably because of the extended battery life. 3 of 5 stars 5. Screen Quality.  The screen is simply beautiful and large yet its not clumsy to hold on to. 5 of 5 stars 6. WiFi Range.  Quite Excellent - It will grab even the most distant WiFi networks. 5 of 5 stars 7. Built In Apps.  The email and other built in apps are flawless.  5 of 5 stars. 8. App Stores.  I had no problem with Google Play or Amazon App Store running at the same time.  5 of 5 stars 9. Battery Life.  The battery lasts all day for me and then some to spare.  I usually have about 50% battery life after a full day of work. 10 of 5 stars! 10. Pulse Sensor, The S5 has some built in apps for health and a finger heartbeat sensor.  It works ok, but its a little temperamental.  3 of 5 stars 11. Kit Kat Version.  Its awesome! Lots of really cool embedded functions like looking at two apps at the same time on your screen. 5 of 5 stars 12. Built In Cameras. Holy Cow! Its the best I have ever used on a smart phone. 10 of 5 stars 13. Phone Microphone. The people say my calls are very clear, the clearest of any cell phone I have had ever! 5 of 5 stars. This phone is a quantum leap ahead of any other Android phone or device out there.  It simply runs like the fastest computer you ever owned.  I highly recommend this phone!|on April 19, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

2869|I received my Galaxy S5 last night, and I'm absolutely loving it so far!  Setup was extremely easy.  Amazon will send you an email once your order has shipped with instructions on what to do.  Once you've finished with that part, the phone has a wizard that will take you through the rest.  For me, this was much better than having a sales associate do it while I wait. I upgraded from an OLD Samsung Droid Charge, so this phone is quite a jump from what I've been using.  My husband has an S3, and there are noticeable differences between those models, as well.  I'm not a super techy person, so I won't get into specs and the such.  However, I really like the design and the feel of the phone in my hand.  Everything that I've had a chance to set up and play with so far has worked almost flawlessly, and of course the screen looks wonderful. My only slight hesitations are with the finger print sensor and heart monitor.  It's probably just me adjusting to something different, but I rarely am able to unlock my phone on the first scan of my thumb.  I saved my scan at two different angles - straight down and with my thumb held sideways - but I still haven't quite gotten the hang of it.  Hopefully this will improve as I get used to doing it, though.  Also, I'm not sure how accurate the heart monitor is.  It seems a little all over the place, but I really like the rest of the fitness app so far.  Neither of these things are real gripes, most likely just things that will improve with time and use. UPDATE 4/30/14: I felt the need to update my review regarding my last paragraph.  I have definitely gotten used to both the fingerprint security/unlock and the heart rate monitor.  Both are working very well now that I've had the phone a few weeks. Other important things to note are (1) how much I love the driving mode that allows for completely hands free voice commands!  This is WONDERFUL and remedies my concern about trying to unlock my phone while driving using the finger print swipe.  (2) I also am super impressed with the camera on this phone.  It is seriously as good as most point and shoot cameras I've owned.  Still loving my new phone!|on April 17, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2870|I have been up for an upgrade for many months, but nothing piqued my interest until this phone and the HTC One M8 came out. It took me a while to debate between the two phones, but here is what eventually sold me on the Galaxy S5: -Wireless charging option. I plan on getting the replacement back cover and a wireless charger for my desk, as well as a wireless charging car dock -Camera. Higher Megapixels and faster focusing. Low light is still not great, but an improvement. This phone takes pictures very quickly. -Fingerprint scanner. Not as convenient as on the iphone, but still a nice way to unlock the phone. -Battery is replaceable and of significant mAH. -IP67 rating Here are some other thoughts: -I liked the HTC one M8's dual front speakers, but it added a significant length to the phone, which frankly, all these phones are on the large side already. -I like the aluminum back of the M8, but I know that I would scratch it quickly, it doesn't allow for wireless charging, and is not easily replaceable. In this regard, I actually like that the S5 has a plastic back that is replaceable. -Both HTC and Samsung has some nifty software features with their own flare, and Kit Kat is also nice - on both phones. -the infrared port is fun to play with to control the tv and bluray player, and works quite well. I do plan on adding a tempered glass cover to try out and see how well it works. I am undecided about cases, especially since I intend on wirelessly charging, and the replacement back cover isn't available yet, and most likely will add some thickness. I want to get the wireless charging cover before I look for cases. With the Qi standard, it should be able to charge through the thickness of the case. One reason why I want to wirelessly charge, is to keep the USB 3 door cover closed at all times to retain the IP67 rating, and not have to worry about that as well as wearing out the charging port. Other factors that I generally like about the S5, but were not the deciding factors: -heartbeat sensor -usb 3, faster transfers if I directly connect the phone to the computer, as well as compatibility with a greater number of cables (both 2.0 as well as 3.0 now) -All current wireless standards (including mimo for ac, dual band, etc.) -2.5 Ghz processor The Galaxy S5 is not THE best in every aspect (I wish it had a better speaker, more abilities from the lock screen, came stock with the wireless charging back, more Ram, etc.), but it is excellent (if not the best) in many areas, and overall for me, was the best option and compromise from what is currently is available. I keep my phones for at least 2 years (my last phone was the Droid Razr MAXX), and I expect to be able to hold on to this phone for at least that length of time considering the features of the S5, especially the battery which tends to be the shortest lasting part of any phone.|on April 17, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2871|I got the phone on Friday. Enjoying it very much so far. The reason I am writing this review is to comment on the finger print reader. I read lots of reviews on the GS5 and was expecting the finger print reader to be Error prone. Many of the reviews I have read say the reader fall short of the Iphone finger print reader.  I have never owned an Iphone with there finger print reader , and I assume it may be a little nicer then the Samsnung finger print reader, although the Samsung finger print reader seems flawless to me and a very nice way to unlock the phone.|on April 13, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2872|I brought the latest and greatest from wonderful ATT, very nice people and will help you with any problems... I send it back, poor sound quality.  Sounds like people are in a barrel and the back vibrates, if you have it turned up to loud. Plus, no zoom!  I have a Note II and plenty of zoom...I'll wait for Note IV!|on April 13, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
2873|It is about the same as the s4 but its good to be updated with the newest version of phone|on April 13, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2874|Everything on this phone is better than the Galaxy S4. The internals, the camera, and the build quality. The phone is a little bit larger and harder to hold than its predecessor so if you have small hands you might want to hold the device before purchasing it. Check out the video for an overview of the device and its features! Make sure to check out the beginning of the video on the DarGadgetZ youtube channel since I can't upload videos longer than 10 minutes.|on April 13, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

2876|So glad I upgraded. Much much faster than the S3. Compared to the S3: Apps snap open; Windows slide smoothly; Calls are made and answered instantaneously. Battery life is also noticeably better. The size is bigger, but that's a minor tradeoff in my book.|on April 12, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2877|I purchased the Samsumg Galaxy S3 when it first came out. Due to an unlimited data contract, I had opted to continue on through the S4 and just now decided to lose my unlimited data by upgrading to the S5. I must say, losing unlimited data is absolutely worth it. Likes The remote control feature. I have a horrendous habit of leaving my TV remote across the room. The IR sensor makes changing the channel possible with my phone. It also linked up to my cable provider to show me what is playing, and changes my TV to that particular channel. Gimmicky? Maybe, but I love it. Fingerprint security - very fast. Not as good as iPhone 5S, but still very viable as a means of security. Hopefully will be opened up to other apps and services, such as Google. A lot of people complain that you must be very accurate while moving your finger across the sensor. I have moved my thumb straight up and down as well as tilted 90 degrees and successfully unlocked my phone. In fact, the only angle I haven’t been able to unlock my phone is by having my thumb oriented upside down. Battery - I haven't had the opportunity to extensively test the battery life yet. However, worth ultra power saving mode on (turns off non essential apps and makes the screen greyscale) the phone reports 10 days of battery life with an 84% charge. IP67 - No dust, no water! I love feeling a little more safe around water. Although the charge port cover is quite annoyingly in the way when it's open. Camera is one of the best I’ve ever used on a smartphone. Clear, crisp pictures and a FAR more intuitive UI than I experienced on the Galaxy S3. The only complaint I have is that it takes a few seconds for the camera to start, which makes it hard to catch impromptu moments! Fantastic call quality. Beautiful screen. 5.1in full HD Super AMOLED Dislikes The capacitive button to the left of the physical button no longer handles settings/menu. Now it’s your multitasking button. My S3 handled multitasking by long pressing the physical button. It’s a small dislike, and something I’m sure I’ll get used to. But I don’t like it for now. Verizon has disabled the use of the download booster mode which allows 4G and Wifi to act together to enable faster downloads. Bloatware. This is becoming a staple with smartphones, and you can disable almost all bloatware in Android. It does still annoy me! No Lockscreen Widgets. At the time of this writing, it is impossible to add lockscreen widgets. Also, if you customize the current lockscreen, you lose the ability to have fingerprint security. The Fence Still plastic +Makes the phone lighter -Feels more prone to break Heart-rate Monitor -Gimicky. I don’t think it will see a lot of use, but only time will tell. Overall: It's a great phone with some very minor issues. If you're upgrading from the S4, I'd skip it, but anything older, and you should absolutely get in on it!|on April 12, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
2878|I have only had this phone for a day but I absolutely love it.  I owned the HTC ONE M8 for a few weeks and returned it for the S5. Without getting into insane technical comparison, I've listed some subjective comparison points. - Build: The M8 is a thing to behold.  As people say, you haven't seen the phone until you've held it.  That said, I was scared to death to scratch or drop the thing.  I'm not a case guy at all and a part of me dies when I see someone slap a huge Otterbox case around a magnificent piece of hardware. To each his own. I understand people are clumsy and drop things, but I get irritated when 'fanboys' trash a rival manufacturers build....but then put an enormous case on theirs.  Anyways, I just prefer the lighter plastic build of the S5.  The back cover feels great in the hand and the buttons are all placed in the most convenient spots (for me anyway).  I appreciated HTC moving the power button to the right-top side....but it's still very difficult to reach.  I've changed phones a lot in recent years and one thing I've learned is that you need a solid week or two with a phone to really form an opinion on a build. Battery: Seems pretty even here.  Both get excellent battery life that you'll get entire day out of.  Really excited for the wireless charging covers to be released.  Don't think people know how convenient wireless charging is if their device allows for it....especially if you have to remove a cover every time you want to connect a cable (which I know isn't the end of the world, but it's the little things, right??) Unless you're some crazy heavy user that plays games all day and watches movies on a 5" device.....you'll love the battery life. Camera: GS5 takes this one but not by much.  For normal day to day Instagram photos, both devices are excellent.  The selfie front camera on the HTC One was surprisingly awesome!  Felt like they should have used that lenses for the back. Keep in mind this phone take high res pictures that turn into large files.....so send with caution.  (5-6mb files) TouchWiz: I typically DESPISE Touchwiz.  I've used a Note 1, 2, 3, Galaxy S3, S4...and now S5.  This is the first time I've actually considered it a viable option to stock Android.  Samsung has definitely cleaned things up.  My favorite fixes include the messaging app.  They've changed in subtle ways to bring it up to date. Kit Kat allows you to choose your default messaging app now (which is awesome!) but this is the first time I've wanted to stick with the stock app. (priority senders is a cool option) Speakers: The BoomSound speakers obviously crush the GS5 here.  However, unless this is a feature that you absolutely need....the GS5 speakers are serviceable.  I found it very fun to show off the HTC speakers to friends.....but in normal day to day life I keep my phone silenced almost the entire time. (nobody can stand hearing your notification sound go off constantly). ALSO, nobody has brought this up, but when you leave the HTC ONE M8 in your pocket any kind of small dust or dirt particles get jammed in the speaker grill!!!!  I wish I could attach a photo of this but it was irritating!  That freshly drilled speaker hole look goes away in about a few days.  Tried blowing on it but didn't seem to work.  Just a heads up. Misc: Wish the headphone jack was on the bottom.  Had gotten used to that on other devices. Conclusion:  Just wanted to give a few points to those on the fence. You can't go wrong with either phone.  It really comes down to build quality.  The HTC was something that will definitely turn heads and feel nice and cold in the morning, but remember that summer is coming up.  The GS5 will be much more friendly in the elements. Hope this helps.|on April 12, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
2879|Compared to my Samsung Note II, it blows the S5 out of the water.  I'm always asking people to speak up or say it again.  But, with the Note II, they come in loud and clear, to loud.  But for a senior, that's good news, with a little hard of hearing.  Other than that, I think the S5 is light, colorful and sharp looking.  But, if I can't hear people, what good is it?  Going back to ATT.  Really nice folks.|on April 11, 2014|3.0 out of 5 stars
2880|Look and feel is great. First issue though was charging.  It uses USB Micro 3.0 (the extra wide plug) that is totally non-standard.  However, Samsung support states that you can use standard USB 2.0 Micro for charging. Quoted chat session below: Chat InformationPlease wait for a Samsung Agent to respond. Chat InformationYou are now chatting with 'Kathy'. There will be a brief survey at the end of our chat to share feedback on my performance today.
