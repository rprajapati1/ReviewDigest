1|This phone is amazing! The stock android experience is amazingly smooth and I had no speed problems with heavy gaming. The only problem that I did have with it was the battery life, which held for a shorter amount of time per day after a few months. Other than that, the phone is great and lives up to the "nexus" lines name|on July 27, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

6|I have a Nexus 5 32GB model since its release October 31st 2013, well got it Nov 1st  2013 from Google's Play Store. Initially when I got it, the device was amazing, smooth, and all around just a great phone. My only complaint when I got it was in its speaker placement. It has 2 identical speaker grills on the bottom but 1 is actually the microphone. After a bit of use till now (June 8th 2015) I noticed the phone gets (for lack of a better word) squirrelly, when you connect the charger to the phone. It seems when I have the charger connected the touch precision goes down every once in a while, and even more often when you scroll in any direction in any location it gets slightly choppy and then, all of the sudden it flys through the scrolling way past what you were scrolling to. The charger issue deos not make it more unusable, just a little more difficult. When not charging  the phone runs fine and is really fast, even for today's new line of phones it still seems pretty smooth. Updates as per usual with the Nexus line are first hand to the devices, and don't take long to arrive after launch. I have made a habit of gaming or watching videos/movies with my fingers  curved so as not to cover the speaker but do the same on the top, which is especially easy since I have large hands. Movies play great on this device at 1080p without issue and games are really great as well. Games I play smoothly that are 3d and come without a hitch: Modern Combat (with and without a MOGA Pro), Need for Speed Most wanted/Hot persuit, Order and Chaos, Izanagi, Ghoat Simulator, Star Wars the Old Republic (with or without the MOGA Pro), Sonic 4 episode 1, Shadowgun Deadzone, Soul Calibur, and emulators for psp, ps1, n64, and DS which all play smoothly. I have also played some browser flash games using Puffin Browser, which supports flash and played games like Adventure Quest Worlds and a few others, not all were smooth but most were playable. On my average use today with web browsing here and there throut the day, texting, and calling, I get about 9-14 hours of battery life, and if I just text or call I get about 16-20 hours on light use. All and all a pretty good phone, but again, the charging issue is annoying with the squirrelly behavior. This review is tapped up using the Nexus 5. Summery: Pros: - Nice Screen - Smooth interface - Fast hardware - Good Camera - Vanilla Android with no bloatware like many other phones -Not bad with gaming -Great 1080p Video playback Cons: -Gets choppy/ squirrelly sometimes while charging. -Camera in today's day is starting to seem out of date- ish Final thoughts: With all its updating and smooth hardware and software, it makes it hard to want to bother even upgrading. My only reason I would have to upgrade would be to not have the charger bug, better camera, and smoother emulated gaming and flash gaming. Which isn't a big deal to me.|on June 8, 2015|4.0 out of 5 stars

10|I would personally would not go for LG phones. I have had Moto, 2 Samsung, iphone and LG (nexus 5) so far and only LG's phone lasted exactly (I mean exactly) its warranty period. The phone just died sitting on my desk without any warning. After repeated request to LG they did not honor the warranty and were charing me 72$ for repairs. Their call center folks have no customer service concept. So, exactly 15months after I activated the phone it goes dead for no reason, LG charges you money to fix some issue which I know lot other customers also faced (power reset issue) with their Nexus 5. This seems to be a cheap tactics which LG is deploying by selling faulty product and charging customers to pay up to fix the same issue. No more LG products for me please and I would recommend you to stay away from their products. They may look good, work nice but would suddenly die and you pay up for repair. I m no iphone fan, but now switching back to iphone atleast the phone will last for two years.|on April 28, 2015|1.0 out of 5 stars

13|Fabulous phone.  I decided to get a Google phone because I had a Nexus tablet.  I just turned on the phone, once activated, and everything synced automatically.  I love it!  Everyone was like..."you paid how much for a phone??  Mine was free."---Yeah with your two year contract where you pay $100 a month.  I bought this phone outright because I use Consumer Cellular.  My bill is $35 a month.  In one year I more than make up for the cost of the phone.|on April 19, 2015|5.0 out of 5 stars

16|Argh, I really want to like this. The phone itself is great. The screen looks crisp, the camera issues have been ironed out with patching, the phone is quick, the perfect size for someone who wants a phone they can actually fit in their pocket (phablets are stupid, buy a tablet), and it uses Android/Google which is exactly what I wanted. There were a few minor issues like the phone getting incredibly hot running basic game apps but they aren't anything I would knock a star off for. The major problems are mostly software. Since the update to Lollipop, the Nexus 5 has been hit with a myriad of odd issues. This actually happens on many of Androids updates (at least for this phone model). Many of these issues were fixed in the 5.1 patch but there are some device breaking problems that have not been and it seems like there isn't really any attention being given to them ( maybe because the 6 is out?). I have had mine for three months and I have two critical problems on it. First, the wifi option is gone. The screen says. "turning wifi on" and the tab is grayed out so I can't change anything. It has been like that for days. This means everything I do is straight off of my data plan, I used 2 gigs just resetting my phone (for these two issues). The second, and far worse, problem is that it now reboots itself repeatedly, consecutively. If my phone tries to idle into sleep or attempts to lock ( on its own or my actions) it immediately reboots. Once it is rebooted it will sit at the homepage and reboot again. The reboot does not happen if I am doing something or if I set the screen to avoid sleep for 30 minutes (once 30 is up it will reboot). The fact that it only happens on sleep or lock tells me it isn't hardware, it is software. I have tried starting it is safe mode, which means it isn't an app causing the problem, I have tried wiping the cache and I have tried a factory reset. This problem is posted repeatedly on Google forums and no one has any idea how to fix it. The only option I have seen is to contact LG or Google and ship it in for repairs. That will teach me to buy it second hand huh? The phone is nice, I really liked it. The three months I used it I enjoyed and was impressed, having upgraded from a Galaxy S3. I just can't get over the software issues. This particular model seems to encounter many software issues and they are really slow about repairing them. I could even deal with odd issues as long as it didn't affect the primary function of my phone but a phone that kills itself in 2 hours with reboots or shuts down every couple of minutes is unusable. I give the device a 5 star physically but a 3 star overall for a plague of software issues. Maybe I should have stuck with the Galaxy series or tried the HTC One M8. May 7th Update!: So I sent my phone to LG for repairs...in March. Everytime I ask what is happening with my phone (because their website will not update the status) they tell me to wait while they put in a request. The first time I asked was after I waited three weeks. They have been telling me the same crappy, "We will put in a request, please wait" message for over two weeks. I have not had this phone since March and it is a full week into May. LG support is literally the worst support I have ever had to deal with and I have had to contact IbuyPower (I would never wish that on anyone) and applied for student loans (those will keep annoying you long after the paper work). I feel confident that I will never buy an LG phone again out of fear that I will need repairs or customer service. I cannot stress enough, or properly put into words, just how terrible it is to send your phone in for repairs and to know nothing about it for the next month and a half.|on March 15, 2015|3.0 out of 5 stars

21|This is the best smart phone I've ever owned. I would only give it 4 and 1/2 if that were an  option though. And the half star deduction is only because android is not yet a perfect OS.

22|Google is now discontinuing the Nexus 5 with the recent release of the Nexus 6. I did not like the idea of such a big phone/phablet, so I ordered the unlocked Nexus 5 for use in Mexico.

It has the best features a phonr can have and is still affordable! *great size *HD screen *awesome sharp camera *fast charging and no battery drain *very fast n smooth *get Google updates first hand *light weight *nice design and color *great amount of space *unlocked It offers the best a phone can offer, and I'd recommend it to everyone!|on November 30, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

26|I love this LG Google Nexus 5. It is the prefect size, it is fast, and it gets updates straight from google and quickly. I like the pure android operating system with no carrier bloatware and manufacturer skins. I would recommend this device to anyone. This is the best device I have ever used. It has a decent camera, a good battery life, and an excellent screen and processor. I usually get through a full day on a single charge and have near 5 hours on screen time. The photos look great and clear to me, but compared to a better resolution camera and one with better lowlight performance it is still pretty decent. I have no complaints with this phone. Also, I have rooted and installed twrp recovery it but left stock OS as I love pure android. I was surprised as to how simple and easy it was to unlock boot loader and root and install custom recovery, it maybe took me 10 minutes at most. I currently have the official android lollipop upgrade, but I couldn't wait so I downloaded it from google and flashed it. I could have gotten the ota in a few days, but the put it on the developers page for manual install and I took the opportunity to install it. I will definitely recommend this phone as it is a very powerful device.|on November 24, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

The diztronic voyeur case is a great fit.  The large storage space is great too.  About three months ago I cracked the display (no case at that time) and replacing that glass was mostly painless.

38|It's all you can really ask for in a cell phone. My son is an engineer in the cell phone space and this is what he told me to buy. My son said it packs a lot of features in for the price.

On the up side the battery lasts quite a bit longer than it did in my Samsung Galaxy S3 Blaze.|on October 9, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

41|Really. When I purchased this product I was absolutely devoted to Google - owning a Nexus 5, a Nexus 7, Google Fiber in my condo and using their search engine almost exclusively. Google has broken my trust, one device at a time. Reviews regarding the speed, camera quality, slick graphics, etc., are true, but don't let the pretty colors and flashing lights influence your decision. Not only has Google failed to fix old issues that are minor but irritating ex. as pages jumping after they're loaded (Nexus 7 & 5), the Nexus 5 has an even bigger issue: The phone will sometimes not ring when someone is calling. The problem is random and Google is well aware of it and has been "working on the issue".....for about a year. To make matters worse, the phone does not recognize a call was missed. It does not log the call in the Missed Calls history or even the All Calls history. The only way you'll know you missed a call is if the caller leaves a message. The voicemail icon will appear, even though the missed call icon does not. Although smartphones offer many features, if the core function of the device (making & receiving calls) doesn't work, then what use is it? After missing a very important call yesterday, I've decided Google's shining star is tarnished beyond repair. Not only am I selling this phone after less than 6 months of use, I am purging all of their products. The Fiber is problematic and was poorly installed at my condo building. The cables were simply strung across the parking lot and secured to various surfaces using zip ties. After 8 calls to Google over the past year to get this fixed, nothing has been done. The issue of page jumping seems minor, until you click on the wrong link repeatedly because the page jumped as you were clicking. Not only does it waste your time having to backtrack, it also chews up your data usage. In summary, any company that cannot or will not fix their product errors in a reasonable amount of time is a bad bet.|on September 25, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

43|Nexus 5 is (as of Sept, 2014) one of the best Android phones in the market. At 5 inches, the screen is just about right ‚Äì not too big and not too small. The only thing I do not like about this phone that the camera lens sticks out so it looks awkward when putting it flat on its back. But I‚Äôve always used it with a case so that takes care of it. The wireless charging works with non-branded chargers. I‚Äôve actually used Nokia Lumia‚Äôs wireless charger and it works okay, although a bit slow. NFC on this phone works great for use with Google Wallet. I‚Äôve used it to wireless pay at checkout counters. NFC tagging also works and you can create custom tags to do things such as turn off wifi and turn on Bluetooth when entering your vehicle. Overall, this is the best Android phone I have used. I‚Äôve been using it for more than a year now and I would buy it again if I have to (unless Google releases a new device).|on September 21, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

I'm a lady with small hands and it still allows one hand usage which was my biggest concern before I bought it .... The camera is the best in my group of friends , hence I'm always the one taking pictures ... It does run hot a little when playing games for a long period ; but that's expected with any device .... It's a great phone and worth every penny I spent . Just be certain to get a good case to aid in protection against falls and such ...

49|I've had my Nexus 5 for 8 months now. The moment I ordered it, it was delivered without complications. Right on schedule and in perfect condition, in its box. It's everything I expected. I consider its features are great, good option if you're looking for a reasonable value vs. price relation. Its 32 GB storage capacity is more than enough to have all the apps you want. The screen looks amazing. Since it's a Google phone I've gotten timely updates. It's comfortable in size and weight. I do recommend buying a case when you acquire your phone so it remains in pristine condition. And if you're clumsy opt for a case like tech21 impactology, it adds some weight but your phone will handle the drops. As for battery life, I'm pretty happy with it. It lasts a day of use, could last a bit less if you're "demanding" more, like listening to music on your phone for a prolonged time. Satisfied with my purchase! :D|on September 7, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

Pros: - Always up to date with Google's latest OS version. - Great build quality. Feels solid in the hand - Crsip HD display - Powerful hardware. Everything is fast, fluid, and responsive. - Plays mobile games without any trouble (I've been playing Anomaly: Korea all day) Cons: - No expandable memory (Only true con in this list) - Average battery life (Offset by quick charge time and wireless charging) - Mediocre camera (Not really a con. It gets the job done well, just not HIGH quality) - Awkward speaker placement/sound muddled - Screen colors seem off slightly (Hardly noticeable until you compare it to other phones) - Awkward power button placement - Phone built for those with larger hands|on August 25, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

82|The performance of the phone is very good.  Most likely on par with all the major premium phones.  The problems I have had is with the glass used for the screen.  I purchased two of these phones, one for myself and one for my wife. The wife dropped hers and the screen shattered, despite the phone being in a case.  I chalked this up as annoying but possibly just bad luck.  Perhaps it hit at just the right angle. Now with my own device, I am experiencing scratches in the screen.  I have not had any major drops and I am not certain what caused the scratches, but it is concerning.  This isn't our first smart phones, we have previously used Motorola products (four years with a Droid and Bionic) and have never experienced broken or scratched screens. The phone uses Gorilla Glass 3, I am curious how it is performing in other devices?  For my experience in the Nexus 5, it has been quite a disappointment.|on June 16, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

I kept watching videos on youtube on how the phone comes in the package and was expecting the worst for my phone because I didn't order it from the actual store... BUT...to my surprise it came exactly like how it was shown in all the videos from people who got it from the Google Store. So far I am loving this phone! It is indeed Unlocked, I'm from the Caribbean and it works with my sim card just fine. It's beautiful and extremely light & works perfectly. The camera takes great pictures, not exactly perfect like my old HTC One *tear* but still does the job! Even the speakers for me are loud whereas alot of people complained that it wasn't. I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PHONE. I'm going to guard it with my life! Great product from the seller! Would definitely purchase from this seller again if I had to! *Happy customer* :)|on May 29, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

94|I absolutely love this phone. The only improvement that can be made, in my opinion, is battery life. I work from home, constantly next to my wireless charger, so for me it's not a big deal. However I could see some people having trouble getting through a work day on a single charge. Having said that, everything else is awesome. I love the understated looks of the white model - clean, simple. The pure Android experience is absolutely the best way to experience it, and it blows iOS 7 out of the water. I will not buy another iOS device until they play a little catch up. Apple hardware is great, but they are seriously behind the times as far as their OS goes. If you're going to try an Android device after using iOS7, I highly recommend going the pure Google route!|on May 28, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

100|I bought this phone to replace an iphone. I am pleasantly surprised by its capabilities, I am not that tech savy and this phone seems to know where I am going before I do, it shows me traffic conditions, etc. This started a few weeks after I got it. Its easy to use and the battery life is very good, holds a charge for 12+ hours|on May 17, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
101|the nexus arrived on 5/15/14. brand new in original package. handsome looking. i  charged and used it same day.  the phone automatically sleeps after 30 seconds of inactivity, i expect that except today i can't open it despite numerous attempts to hit the switch button.  it is like being in a state of coma. it is alert as it vibrates when i call. however, the screen remains dark, unresponsive, and the nexus tests one's ability on how you can make it rouse from sleep.|on May 17, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

107|Meet all my expectations, the only incomplete fields of this phone, in my opinion, is the lack of an infrared port, some camera features, battery capacity and micro sd card support, but this issues where known from me after my purchase and the principal features in general of this phone make realize that in terms of value/cost, future implementations and posibilities, this phone is unmatched.|on May 1, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars

112|It is a great cell phone, so far the best I've bought, nothing to envy to other models of high gamma, as s4, iphone, etc. The performance is excellent, the only detail is the battery life and not bring headphones, but otherwise for me has nothing to envy to other models thank you very much.|on April 21, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

114|nice phone. works well. arrived with the power plug damaged, I had to fix it. I was expecting more applications pre-installed because the strength of nowadays smartphones is in the quality of the installed applications.

119|The excitement of the phone arriving and unboxing it was a fantastic experience. The phone was great for the first 3 weeks. Not until I started using it heavily with gaming apps. Its not that bad, but there are some minor lags while playing high graphic games. My phone has mysteriously froze once too when I was using the photosphere app. Kind of a disappointment to see a device that's a bit high-end, lag like that. Overall , the phone is great and exciting! I am using it right now to type this review! Lol.|on April 1, 2014|4.0 out of 5 stars
120|I search internet a lot before i purchased the telephone. I dont regret my choice. It works perfect, fast, good color and definition. I love the fact that combines the kit kat ( i dont have to update the os for a while, its enough for me) with a reasonable price. I have been conected even n places with low signal. Im a nexus 7 user, so it was the perfect match.|on March 30, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

122|I bought nexus 5, about 50 days ago from google play store online. Three days later, I accidentally dropped the phone from only two feet high on flat plastic tile (it fell off fron my y-sherts poket when I pick up somting) but the screen glass shattered. I called google to explain them, the google representative transfer phone to LG company. They charged $170 to replace the screen which is half of new phone price. I received the phone two weeks later. The phone is not receiving signal from T-mobile sometimes received one or two bar of low signal but that was E or H signal which is very slow, not even 3G, 4G nor LTE. I did not get any signals indoor at all. I called LG service again to explain, they told me to return the phone again to their service center with provided return label which was not overnight service it was Fedex ground service. I have to wait another two weeks to received my cellphone back. Two weeks later I received phone back from LG but it was same condition. I seems they did not even looked at it. it did not received any strong or fast signal from t-mobile. I called LG again, they told me same thing like two weeks ago. "Send it back to LG". I bought nexus5 I used it for three days, I could not used my phone for more than a month now. LG seems not care, they will send me another ground shipping label to send it back, I have to wait another two weeks. I will never buy LG product again. it broke very easily and their service is very bad. One more, even if evrythig fine, you can not see the screen horizentally while you are wearing sunglases. You can see only black screen untill you turn it to vertical position!!!|on March 26, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars

125|Three of the biggest reasons I bought this phone: 1. World Phone. (Factory unlocked) 2. Pure Android. (Stock KitKat) 3. Affordability (only $350?! WOW) All the other android phones have skins that the manufacturers lay on top of these smartphones which creates TONS of problems, any android veteran will understand what I'm saying. loving the phone so far, silky smooth, and frightfully fast, only downside are the external speakers which aren't loud enough and mediocre at best... other that lovely experience so far no complaints!!!!|on March 18, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

135|I bought the phone last month. The phone fell off my desk while well protected in a plastic case, and the screen is broken. I sent in the phone, and LG says it's not covered by warranty because of physical damage. Now I'll have to pay almost 200 dollars for the repair. The same type of incidents happened to my previous HTC phone at least ten time, and I never had any problem. So, a cheap phone is a cheap phone. You eventually end up to pay more than a good quality product. I also own a LG drier, and it's broken after just more than one year. And I had to pay almost 300 dollars for the repair since it's out of its one year warranty period. From my experience, LG products are of low quality, made of cheap materials, and I will never buy anything made by LG again.|on February 27, 2014|1.0 out of 5 stars
136|This is best flagship phone which gives you pure google experience! I bet you wont be disappointed with this! I ditched my Note 2 for this :)|on February 24, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
137|First of all, pure andriod and you get the latest updates from google as soon as it is released and you don't have to wait 6-12 months to get it on your samsung GS 4 and htc and other manufactures.  I had a galaxy gs4 and purchased this phone until the next galaxy gs5 comes out cause i broke the screen on my GS4.. Never going to get anything else besides a nexus from now on. I still really like the gs5 but the touchwiz and other bloatware on the samsung make it a little laggy and uncomfortable. Apps open so fast and web browsing is much smoother on the nexus. You won't be disappointed.|on February 21, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

142|I was really excited to buy the Nexus 5, and stuck with a half broken phone for months waiting for it. After using it for several months in 2 different networks in 2 countries this is how I feel. The processor is fast and the touch screen is responsive. The camera takes decent pictures. The OS is mostly good... However, it is bogged down by the worst messaging program i have ever used: Hangouts. Hangouts does not (1) tell you when you are online, (2) allow you to set a status, (3) reliably tell you when others are online, (4) tell you others' statuses, (5) send your messages in real time / tell you when they are sent, (6) receive messages in real time, or (7) display received messages properly (it may just not update all the messages in a conversation). Oh and you cannot uninstall it. The response from Google to all the complaints from users is a patronizing "you don't understand how great it is". Sure you can get another SMS program, but the Google Talk app is irrevocably replaced with this turd. So forget 'instant' messaging as a means of reliable communication. Also, the GPS often takes way too long to tell you where you are. Sometimes 5-10 minutes after hitting the location button on google maps. I have had to hard reset once already because of some 'sync' problem with my Google account. (2 hours of tech support was no help.) I had problems even making phone calls because it was not properly communicating with its cloud-dwelling overlord. Google's charge for providing 'free' services is that you remain permanently tethered to their servers as the phone will not function at all (not even phone calls) if you are not logged in. Google Now has some neat features, but most boil down to 3 clicks and a small amount of typing being reduced to 2 and a verbal command (*if you are in a quiet enough place). Novelty you will get over very quickly. I understand that some of these, particularly the Hangout problems, are going to be problems on any Kitkat-running android phone, but I am yet to find a way to dump KitKat from this phone.|on February 10, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars
143|Seriously, if you buy this phone you dont only save your money, it's a better phone than the currents flag ships (2013- early 2014) The hardware is high end, the phone construction is perfect, the screen is sharp. I love this phone. I bought it from amazon because i live in Venezuela and i can't buy it from the Playstore. It's more expensive, but it was worth it.|on February 10, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

160|I have owned this phone for about 2 months now and  the one complaint I have is that after I lock the screen and put the phone away it will sometimes just randomly dial a number.  Once it begins dialing and I hear the ring tone I have to go through several different screens to turn it off usually the person has answered by then and I have to apologize for my phone randomly calling them when I didn't intend to make a phone call.  When its dialing the screen is either blank or the home screen,  when I touch the phone icon it brings up my contact list all the while dialing this random number!!  It is extremely aggravating to say the least.|on January 17, 2014|2.0 out of 5 stars

166|I wish Google had had this item in stock, as this costs more than retail. That said, it arrived a day earlier than it was slated to, and it works perfectly. Broke my Galaxy S4 and needed a new phone mid contract. Very comparable and it feels kind of exclusive because it's technically a 'developer device'. The packaging had tape all over it, as if it had been previously opened, but no sign of anyone doing that. I just like mint packaging. 100% satisfied with my purchase.|on January 9, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
167|This is the best phone I have bought. Screen is so sharp and bright. It is very powerful with Snapdragon 800. The only downside is that the stock camera app sucks so bad. I just bought another camera app for few bucks and problem solved.|on January 9, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars
168|I switched to the Android platform a couple years back and have used the flagship devices from both Samsung and HTC.  This device doesn't have any of the normal bloatware found on subsidized phones from the mobile carriers or the manufacturers.  The resolution is so crisp that my TV is jealous.  The quad core processor provides for a smooth experience that has no lags or choppiness. I am not a big gamer but I got a couple full motion games just to be amazed by the video performance.  All this coupled with the low price make this device the way to go.|on January 7, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

I don't like the micro sim form factor and the fact that the battery cannot be changed. the whole thing is getting too close to the very reasons why I don't like Apple...

173|As there are already detailed reviews about this SMARTphone, I will keep mine short and simple. -> For a person looking at the latest technology (up-to-date gadgets), this has to be your pick. Definitely comes in the top 3 SmartPhone available in the market today. -> Really fast processor that makes every flick/swipe or tap lightening fast - No lags at all -> Google Play Store sells the unlocked version of this SmartPhone at $ 350 (plus or minus a few dollars). -> Designed to look sleek and attractive. No complaints about the design. (Even with a hard-case on the phone looks impeccable) -> Camera has inbuilt image stabilizer to make every click a perfect picture. No more shaky pictures or shaky-hand syndromes. :) -> Refined microphone for better clarity for all those voice-activated or voice-enabled applications. -> Really good video quality. In short, invest in this SmartPhone and never you will not regret. I am right now flashing my new thing-a-ma-jiggy to everyone and making them envious... :)|on January 1, 2014|5.0 out of 5 stars

188|My wife bought the LG G2 at the same time I bought the Nexus 5. Clearly both phones are really impresive. But right now she's really upset with the LG G2, and she want to have a Nexus 5. I'm really glad to make the decision of buying the Nexus. Amazing display, fast as hell, good looking, and the Android 4.4.2 give a plus on usability and friendlyness. Battery isn't the best feature but is quite good.|on December 16, 2013|5.0 out of 5 stars
189|12/21/13 Update: So about 2 weeks ago Nexus 5 users received the 4.4.2 update, it brought many small improvements but the greatest being improving the camera. It shoots very clear shots now, the camera app opens quicker and the camera takes a lot less time to focus. If the camera was something that turned you away from the Nexus 5, then come back because the issue has been fixed. Google says they will keep working on the camera to make it even better.(Stay tuned for any other updates) Original Review: I sold my S3 to get this phone on the Google Play Store and I recommend you do as well (It costs less on the Google Play Store) [...] The total ends up being less than $400 for a smart phone that is priced way to low for what it has to offer. Pricing: $350- 16 GB $400- 32 GB A Snapdragon 800 Quad-Core Processor clocked at 2.3 Ghz? A Adreno 330 GPU, all these sound to good to be true! Such great specifications at such a low price? But, nothing matters if there is no applicable real world performance, and I'm glad to say that you will be zipping through games and apps! Here are some Pros and Cons: Pros: -Phone feels great in the hand, not to big or not to small -Great Build Quality, better than phones that use plastic like the LG-G2 or S4 (It uses the grippy plastic found on the 2013 Nexus 5) -Buttery Smooth and Fast as Lightning, this phone is that fastest phone I have ever used, hands down -Pure Stock Android (Kit-Kat 4.4) -You get updates as soon as they roll out! No waiting for months to get the next version of android Cons: -Because it only packs a 2300 mh battery, it does ok for daily use, but don't expect to get any crazy battery life, (Standby time is amazing though, it sipped through only a 1% of battery through the whole night!) -Camera is decent, but video quality is great! The mic is the best I have seen on any smart phone, (A software update may improve camera) -Availability, I love this phone, but getting your hands on one can take a bit, but please believe me, it is worth the wait! -Speaker is just all right, it sounds OK but not great Total Scores: Build Quality: 9/10 User Experience: 10/10 Android Kit-Kat (Nexus 5 Experience): 10/10 Camera (Photos): 7/10 Camera (Video): 9/10 Speaker: 7/10 Summery: If you looking for a phone that delivers the best Android Experience, a cheap off contract phone, a phone with great specifications, or just a phone in general, This is the best phone currently on the market. While it has some minor flaws, there is no other phone that offers this much for this little. Total Score: 9/10|on December 15, 2013|5.0 out of 5 stars

194|WOW. I absolutely love this phone. So smart and easy to use. Can't believe how quick it is. The instructions you can find on-line, but it's such straight forward to use. The camera is amazing, out of this world. The speakers are so clear and using it on the internet as a tablet it's extremly quick to use. I am very pleased with my new phone, much better than the Nokia Smartphone that I used to have.|on November 26, 2013|5.0 out of 5 stars
195|"Best phone I have ever owned" is a big claim, especially since I recently also owned a brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (with companion Galaxy Gear smartwatch). So let me elaborate... My previous phone (not counting the Note 3) was a Nexus S, one of Google's earlier and not-very-widely-adopted phones. Although made by Samsung, it was a pure Google Android phone with none of the bloat-ware associated with some manufacturers. And with none of the multiple account sign-ups (Google Account + Samsung Hub + ???). I did like the pure Adnroid experience then, and I like it now on the new Nexus 5. Although I missed out on the Nexus 4, two family members each picked up one of those popular phones when Google slashed the price prior to launching the Nexus 5. While those we're outstandingly good value purchases, I'm glad I waited for the Nexus 5 myself. The Nexus 5 is slim and stylish in a very understated way, like a little black dress (but I'm not a girl). Out goes the bling, and in comes a slightly rubberised back which is way nicer than it sounds... and reassuring to hold. The screen is a pleasure to look at, because you can't see the individual pixels, and it's big enough without being a "phablet". It's fast and responsive, 4G-ready, the latest Android 4.4 KitKat, and very good value for the price I paid "in store" soon after launch (hence not a verified purchase here on Amazon). Documentation is scarce, so you may have to do a lot of experimenting or reading around on the web, but there is always¬† The (Unofficial) Google Nexus 5 SmartPhone Book : The missing manual for LG's Android 4.4 KitKat phone . It really is no exaggeration for me to say that I have been telling all my friends that "this is the best phone I have ever owned". And I'm pretty fickle.|on November 26, 2013|5.0 out of 5 stars
196|All the prior reviews are accurate, but I thought it was important to add another perspective from a hands-on user.  I have been a google nexus user for several generations of the devices, enjoying the unlocked phone on T-mobile monthly plans at far less costs than AT&T.  I usually upgrade my nexus phone and pass the older generation to my spouse who doesn't seem to care about the tech specs.  I patiently waited for the release of the Nexus 5, and entered my order within the first hour, receiving the device from google play in early November.  After putting the phone through several days usage, which included minimal talk time (less than 10 min per day), about 10 texts per day, and 5 emails, I was surprised and disappointed to find battery life around 10% at 8pm at night.  If I was to have an active day or busy evening, I would be scrambling to get a quick charge to make it through the entire day.  My prior Nexus phones have seen much better battery life, and I spent a couple of days getting tips from the web to adjust settings to reduce battery drain, but to no significant result.  Perhaps I just had a faulty device.  Nevertheless, I returned my Nexus 5 and did not buy another yet. I may try again, but in the meantime I will wait for a few months to see what other kit kat phones become available.|on November 23, 2013|3.0 out of 5 stars
197|The Nexus 5 is the best Nexus yet and one of the best phones at that. I've had mine for approximately a week and couldn't be happier. I got the white one and think it looks fantastic. With that note, let's get into a review and we'll start on build quality: The build - the phone is solidly built and light too - I personally like a heaver phone being a man with larger hands. So, if you like lighter phones and find others too bulky, this may be refreshing for you. Some professional reviews state the phone is good or mediocre build at best which is patently false. Yes, there's a seam on this phone, especially owning a white version but it isn't some huge gap that's ugly or a place where you can push the two pieces together more. The phone has no creaks at all and the glass is flush on all sides. I mention the glass because I've owned Motorola, HTC, and even iPhones where the glass at the edge isn't even across the whole device and it drives me nuts. The new buttons are ceramic - ohhh! They are nice and work well. The sim card tray is next to the power button but I haven't noticed it at all searching for the button as it's very flush with the phone. There isn't an SD card slot on this phone - get over it. 32GB is enough for MOST users. If you are truly a power user who needs to swap out 64GB cards frequently for whatever reasons (I know some of you do exist) this isn't the phone for you. I'm sorry, the Nexus devices haven't had one in a long time and it's a cost saving measure too. Next is connectivity and calling - the main point of a phone, right? I won't discuss specific networks as that opens up a whole different debate that entire forums can't solve! LTE works screaming fast on the phone and it holds onto the signal well. HSPA+ is a beast on this phone too if your area doesn't have it. Calls connect well and nothing has dropped so far. The call quality is decent, which is a bummer as I'm one who still talks a lot on their phone. I haven't tried any HD voice features yet so that may help the issue. Wifi works well on the phone too both with 5ghz and 2.4ghz - my older router doesn't have all the latest standards but the phone supports any wifi you'll encounter. I'll point out that my house is an old one with huge blocks that love to cancel out any cell signals. This phone holds onto them and keeps them unlike other phones I've used on the same network. Screen - The best I've used. I have grown tired of the Samsung AMOLED screens and favor the route Apple and HTC and now LG have taken, for the most part. It's super crystal clear and even being a near-sighted blind person, I can't pick out pixels for the first time. Colors are pretty accurate and everything is great looking. The touch portion of the screen is great too with no issues. It works as well as any other top tier phone. Now 'for the most part' means I do notice this screen, as any LCD, cannot do true black unlike AMOLED. It's a feature left to that technology alone but it doesn't detract here as the screen is great and you don't notice unless you have a competing phone next to it. Battery - It's average on this phone. It isn't a beast like I've had on some Moto phones but it isn't a junker like some Samsung devices I've used too. After the first couple days, it evened out and with moderate use I can make it to 10pm bed-time. It isn't going to blow you away but it isn't the worst out there either. I'd have liked an option to use a removable battery as I don't mind a heavier device or battery - but clearly we are going to wafer light and thin devices. Camera - It's a good camera to me and leaps and bounds better than any past phone I've owned including other Nexus devices. Pictures come out clear and the HDR+ feature is pretty good as well. Pictures come out sharper and it even works well trying to take a picture of my moving baby. I can still tell it was taken with a phone vs. a stand-alone camera, but it's way more sufficient for my wants than I need. The wife takes the serious pictures, I just take pictures of things to make sure I bought the right item. So, if you aren't a budding photographer, this thing works well and even captures moving people well enough. Software - The new KitKat 4.4 is here and overall I love it more than the last version, just like I do with every android release. I won't give a comprehensive review of the OS here, but I'll touch on some things. Google added some developer options on this phone that you can enable as an option that make it scream. It moves faster than I can use it now and this is a great step for any phone OS. I've used Windows Phone 8 and many flavors of iOS and many versions of Android. This is by far my favorite OS now, hands down. MS has done well with 8, but this blows that out of the water now. iOS 7 has veered off to me and I personally don't like it. Anyway, this thing is fast! Google now is better than ever, but I had to turn it off as it sucked battery down. I hope Google addresses this as the service is awesome. Hangouts is cool that everything is in one spot, but it's clunky to use for SMS and everything. I wish google would have waited until everything in hangouts was totally done before merging, but they at least give you the option to download another SMS program and set it as the default now. You have got to love choices. Default email is better now and Gmail and calendar are excellent as ever. Overall it's a pleasant step forward and hardly anything I don't like. That's a basic review of the phone and I'll end with the overall value and point of the phone. Here on this great online retailer, the phone appears to cost more. You can easily go to the source, if available in your country, and purchase it for an incredibly great price. It is completely unlocked so you don't have to fiddle with buying an unlock code, which in the USA is now shady anyway, and waste more time and money. This phone also will get updates quickly without hassles or being left in the dust instantly. It's also priced at a mid-tier value, for almost all top tier specs and experiences. I think many pro-reviewers have worried that things like the camera or battery aren't toe to toe with other phones, but those do cost more. The bigger issue they miss is Android on this phone is unlike it on any other phone. That's worth something too and what I stress is the most important thing about this phone.|on November 22, 2013|5.0 out of 5 stars
198|One short and sweet one liner -> Nexus 5 is literally a big brother of iPhone 5s. Its as beautiful as black iPhone 5S and Kitkat OS is on par (actually better) with iOS. You can say its bigger iPhone (I mean it) because Android OS is more flexible, customizable and powerful and it is bigger than in size like its big brother. The bigger size definitely helps in games and all kind of media consumption. This device performance is buttery smooth and the overall experience inspires utmost satisfaction. Given its size it feels so light and slim even compared to iPhone 5/5s. It is not even best nexus device so far but best out yet among all. And now I will explain it. -------------------------- 1. Design, look and build quality-> I differ here from most reviewers who says its plain or boring and nothing stands out of this. Its as good looking as black (space gray) iPhone 5S. Its all black like iPhone 5s. Though its made of plastic its feels sturdy, well built with precision only known to Apple. And for the people who tell iPhone made of aluminum, Nexus 5 sides appears no inferior to iPhone 5S black sides. The front glass is very well fused with the body with almost no gaps. Now what we are left with? Back? The back of Nexus 5 is though made of plastic it feels very good in the hand and due to its matte finish does not seem to slip off. Now one step further... iPhone 5S black (or space gray) seems to have identity crisis of being black or something else, Nexus 5 black is perfectly black and it has got radically different sides (not plain round rectangle which all other smartphones have). The sides are beautifully something else. iPhone 5S beauty is revealing and Nexus 5 beauty being black is mysterious and never gets boring. I love this black beauty and don't blame for my taste as they said "beauty lies in the eyes of beholders". "Simplicity is Beauty and Beauty is simplicity, nothing more, nothing less." - Oscar Wilde. If any phone on the market lives up to the Oscar Wilde's quote its Nexus 5. In short its unapologetically simple". 2. Processor/speed-> Buttery/silky smooth. Neck to neck with iPhone 5s and second only to Note 3 for all practical purposes. 3. Screen/display-> Awesome. Its better than retina any time as its full HD. The feeling of display being washed up goes away very soon and remember the so called best retina have the same problem as they share the same display technology. 4. Ecosystem-> Android eco system is as good as Apple's. In fact I find it better because of Android OS power you have kind of powerful applications which Apple fan boys can never have. Apple fan boys just give a try to 'tasker' (Warning: Only if you can handle Android's raw power.) 5. Powerful Soul-> "Fools are those who don't want their souls to be powerful." Its as good as iOS but better why? because its powerful and customizable. You can do the things with it when you need. Its no way comparable to inferior iOS. Apple fan boys! People should not be proud of a system which does not even let them change default for anything. 6. Call Quality -> Fantastic. I have never had so clear voice on call for very long. 7. Network Signal Quality -> Fantastic. 8. Volume/Speaker-> Inherently the speaker is very loud. Though in some application it might sound a little short of enough but its software related problem and should be fixed in future update. I have tested the volume in many application like play and in some apps are freaking load. While playing music through play I had to cut down on the volume in car its so powerful. With headphones its fantastic. The voice quality is very superior and has no noise in it. Its as pure as it gets. 9. Camera-> I have seen all the comparisons of Nexus 5 with all leading phones (HTC one, Nokia Lumia, iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4) and its competing neck to neck in every department except its little slow to focus. But once it focus it takes very good images. HDR+ beats all other phones (I swear it). But again Google admitted it was software related issue and would be fixed soon through update. Personally I am pretty satisfied with the camera. Its at least best nexus phone camera and comparable to others except in little slower to focus. The photos are very detailed with accurate colors. Note: I have uploaded some photos for reference. 10. Battery-> No complaints. Nothing great or bad here. Its definitely better than many old phones (including galaxy nexus) and equal to many others. It just falls short of only two smart phones right now which are LG G2 and Note 3. But it's battery is comparable to the best smartphone i.e. iPhone 5s. So if iPhone 5S can be the best with that kind of battery I don't understand how we could complain of Nexus 5. For casual usage you will charging it once a day. The noticeable thing is that in idle mode it does not eat battery at all and that's where it will average out better end of the day. 11. Reparability-> iFixit has given its 8 of 10 in this department and you should feel comfortable saving your money on costly repair by doing many things yourself and the whole assembly is modular. Summary-> Even keeping its lower price aside, Its the one of best smart phone and should equal or better any best smart phone on the planet right now. And you add advantage of lower price...|on November 21, 2013|5.0 out of 5 stars
199|I've had a number of phones.  The delightful, but underrated and underpowered, Palm Pre, several Samsung Galaxy phones, most recently the Galaxy Nexus. The Nexus 5 blows them all away.  It is blindingly fast.  There something between little and no lag when you tap on an icon until the app launches.  Is this due to the hardware or KitKat?  I don't know, but I also don't really care. The battery life, and power management, are better than the previous phones.  One of my ongoing issues with the Samsung phones is that while I was driving with my phone plugged into a charger when I using the GPS, playing an audio file to my radio, and having my Bluetooth headset active, the battery drained.  I'd lose 30% of my charge in an hour drive.  And the battery would overheat, with the whole phone becoming uncomfortably hot. With the Nexus 5, I do all that stuff and the battery gains charge!  I've gotten into the car with the phone at less than 80% charge and gotten to work with the battery fully charged and the phone wasn't hot to the touch. The camera is great and the screen is amazing. Are other phones better?  Maybe.  And surely something better will be along in six months.  But for now, I'm a very happy camper. A quick note - the phone is available at the Google Play Store for $349 for a 16gb version and $399 for a 32gb version.  Mine was in my hands 4 days after I ordered it, well before Google promised to ship it.  As long as the phone is available from Google at a better price, why pay these inflated prices?|on November 20, 2013|5.0 out of 5 stars

201|I've been a long time Nexus brand user, owning the first generation Nexus 7 and Nexus 4. I also have an iPad 3 and an iPod Touch 4th generation. I wrote a lengthy Nexus 7 review before; here is my lengthy Nexus 5 review updated after over a month of straight usage. It should cover the vast majority of topics on the device. Let's get started on what possibly is the best high end phone deal in America. (1) Hardware: Personally, in my opinion, high to medium end devices from reputable brands have reached the point where most people won't be able to tell the difference or the difference won't be something they regularly use. That said, I'm still going to cover it, if you're not interested in the nerd talk about hardware, then all you need to know is that the phone is capable hardware wise for demanding users and honestly overkill for average users. Skip this section of my review and head on down to the camera portion. The device is built on a Qualcomm S800 Pro processor. Clocked at 2.2 GHz quadcore processor, the phone screams on speed. I'm not a fan of mobile benchmarks due to their inherent problems of actually measuring what they claim, but benchmarks all put the Nexus 5 at the moment in the top end of performance. Compared to my Nexus 7's Tegra 3, the Nexus 5 has a fighter jet engine compared to the first generation Nexus 7's turboprop engine. There's also a Hynix 2 GB RAM chip running at DDR3 1600 Mhz, and either a 16 GB or 32 GB Sandisk NAND memory chip depending which model you bought. Google is charging $50 more for the 32 GB device. That's about a 625% markup over wholesale NAND prices. Take that as you will. There are Bluetooth, NFC, GPS and unlike the Nexus 4, a slim-port compatibility, thus letting you connect the phone to a monitor or television screen. LG/Google kept the wireless charging from the Nexus 4, to which the wireless charger has to be purchased separately. The phone comes with an Adreno 330 graphics chip. I'm not a big mobile gamer, but this per the professional reviews and FPS benchmarks will handle every game out for Android. For non-gamers, the Adreno 330 is overkill. Microphone and talk clarity are on par with Nexus 4, meaning fine. Speaker seems to have more noise at higher volumes. Also, speaker is mono despite there being two grills at the bottom. One grill is for the microphone. Connects via standard USB, where the device itself has a microUSB connection. Plugging the device into your computer brings it up as another removable storage device where you can simply drop and drag files into folders. Easy file movement plus standard USB makes the device very simple to use and standard charging conventions make it easy to find chargers around your house and office. Sometimes the device goes wonky on USB connection (was a Nexus 4 issue as well), so just go into settings and storage, click on the settings (3 vertical boxes) and change the connection to PTP or MPT and the phone will reappear properly. Like all recent Nexus devices, no MicroSD slot and no removable battery. MicroSD slot is partially alleviated now that USB OTG works. See my "other" section for more details. You can find these specific parts on iFixit's tear down which gave it a solid 8/10 for user repair. For the low price of $349/$399, there is no other phone with this quality hardware that for the price. Right now, due to shortages in supply, many people are scalping the phones for profit. If you can wait, the phone will ship between 2 and 4 weeks and if the Nexus 4 timeline tells us anything, quickly reach the point where it's under a week. My phone took a little under 3 weeks to deliver from ordering it on the 1st of November. (2) Camera: The back camera is still an 8 megapixel and front is 1.3 megapixel, same as the Nexus 4. Low light has improved considerable and HDR+ alleviates many of lighting problems. HDR is a software/hardware combination that takes three photos, one underexposed, one overexposed and one regular and the software combines them to even out the lighting issues to produce the best possible shot. Graininess has been reduced as well. Google keeps the same minimal interface for the camera with the select and drag method for changing options. Image stabilization is so-so and the camera can be slow to focus at times. The Nexus 5 camera is an improvement over the Nexus 4, but a Lumia this is not.  Google released updates to the Android OS that had specific Nexus 5 camera fixes. The camera's improved, but it's still relatively slow at focusing. However, image quality has improved considerably as have night shots. The only real criticism now is that the camera is slow to focus. (3) Android 4.4 - Operating System: Google's latest and greatest is on display here. Android 4.4, otherwise known as Kitkat comes pre-installed on the phone. There are some changes from Android 4.3 Jelly bean. Like all Nexus devices, operating system updates are done over the air via Google. No waiting on device manufacturers or carriers. The launcher has changed and on the Nexus 5 (and it's exclusive to the Nexus 5), and widgets are now removed from the app screen and are accessed by pressing and holding down on a home screen. Icon sizes have been enlarged in the app library, and formatting has been tweaked. Android Run Time (ART) is now available as opposed to the stock Google Dalvik compiler. Allegedly, ART nets a handful more hours out of the device per some reviews, but I haven't noticed any difference. In theory, ART should speed up the device, but with the S800 Pro already blazing fast, it's questionable if anyone will notice, your mileage will vary. Also, some apps are broken under ART. Google has prominently placed Google search on the top of the phone and included the new function of simply talking to your phone to have it fulfill requests. Simply say "Ok Google" and the Google Now function loads up where you can ask questions or request information simply by talking to it. Phone has to be unlocked for it to work as opposed to the Moto X which I believe will work without unlocking. Hangouts has merged with text messaging for a combined app. As with all Android phones, you can download another app and make it your default over Hangouts. Currently the Hangouts change in my opinion was a mistake. Group texting via SMS has problems with sending, the app prioritizes sending to Gmail accounts over SMS and you can't mix SMS and Gmail group chats together. The separation in 4.3 was a better system. Google kept the Sywpe like typing option on its default keyboard (drag your fingers between keys rather than typing) and notification center appears to be the same from 4.3. Colors however for notification went from blue to white. Also the notification flashing light is still there from the Nexus 4. It's sort of like the Blackberry's red flashing LED, but at the bottom. Outside of the changes from 4.3, stock Android 4.3, stock meaning there's no "skin" over it such as Touchwiz or HTC's Sensation, runs extremely fast. Apps load instantly, everything is extremely responsive. This is not Android Honeycomb that was an unresponsive lag filled mess. It is however, less intuitive than iOS 6/7. Android verse Apple has always been like this and its personal preference. That said, if you're in to nearly complete customization, widgets, lock screen information and generally busting out of a walled garden to have your phone do what you want it to do, this is your cup of tea. (4) Battery Life: The battery life on the Nexus 5 is better than the Nexus 4. A slight boost of 200 mAh to 2,300 from 2,100 mAh is minor and it appears the gains are from the operating system primarily. Some user are reporting with ART, they can last a full day as opposed to 16 to 17 hours on Dalvik, some users are reporting the same battery life. After more than a month of the usage on the device, I find that battery life is generally superior to the Nexus 4 and going a whole day is not a problem. This isn't a Note 3 that will last all day gaming. Mileage will vary depending on your behavior. The biggest killer of battery aside from constant gaming is using LTE in an area with weak LTE signal. The phone (like all phones) will eat up huge amounts of battery trying to maintain the bad signal. Sometimes it will drain 20% of my battery in an hour or two on standby. Switching to 3G as the primary network reduces standby usage to a few percent over two or three hours. (5) Build & Looks: The phone comes in two colors, black and white. Note that the white version does not extend the white to the front; it's just the back panel. The phone is fairly light and considerably lighter than the Nexus 4. It is still a black rectangle like most smartphones. LG/Google have forgone the glass backing from the Nexus 4. This should significantly reduce real damage as the soft plastic backing is far less susceptible to shattering like glass. The phone is a bit thinner than the Nexus 4. Screen is 4.95 inches, with confirmed Gorilla Glass 3. The phone is using IPS which gives better clarity and color than the Nexus 4. Resolution is set at 1,920-by-1,080 pixel for a 445 pixel density (PPI). I'd still use a screen guard as the face drop test reveals that Gorilla Glass 3 is good for preventing scratches, but so-so to horrendously bad on impact resistance. Side bezels are very minimal, but the top and bottom bezels are still large. Overall, it's not going to wow people upon first look, but most of us are here for performance and pure Android, what excites us is not how a phone looks, but what we can do with it. (6) LTE & Carrier Support: Google is selling these phones completely unlocked, meaning that you can go to any carrier that supports its bands and it should work. Unlike the Nexus 4, the Nexus 5 is LTE enabled. This was a huge reason for me to get the Nexus 5 as I'm paying for T-Mobile's LTE on the simple plan but I wasn't able to access it. My local HSPA+ was topping out around 11 Mbp/s in the heart of Honolulu to a paltry 4 Mbp/s in my house away from the heart of the city. LTE has pushed urban speed to over 30 Mbp/s (per my last test) and my house to over 9 Mbp/s. Your mileage will of course vary. Nexus 5's LTE will work with bands on T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T. Verizon has some LTE bands that the Nexus 5 doesn't support and Verizon and Google have some ideological issues that are preventing them from working together on the Nexus line. T-Mobile is selling the device non-subsidized at a $100 markup financed over 24 months at 0%. Sprint is selling the phone subsidized at $49 but you'll pay it all back and more through subsidy recovery fees built into the monthly bill. AT&T isn't selling the device but will support BOYD Nexus 5. Be aware though, unless you're on AT&T's prepaid Aio service, you're still going to be paying for subsidy recovery fees even though you didn't get a subsidy from AT&T. A lot of people don't seem to understand that the amount they pay for the phone on day one, usually $199 is not the total price they pay for the phone. That's the down payment. AT&T/Sprint/Verizon and previously T-Mobile recover their subsidy via the fees they charge in their monthly. T-Mobile and other non-contract carriers have broken out of this model and give a dosage of transparency to monthly billings as to what is service fee and what is subsidy recovery. If you buy an unlocked phone from Google and take it to T-Mobile, you will not be charged a device fee. If you take it to Verizon/AT&T/Sprint outside of their prepaid options, you will be charged a device fee even though you did not get a subsidy. This will vastly increase the total price you pay for your phone. Keep that in mind. The best deal for this phone if you don't talk much is T-Mobile's $30 a month plan for 100 minutes, unlimited text and 5 GB of LTE, unlimited 3G. Download Google Voice for data calling if you need more talk time. For two years of service, that's $1,069 in total monthly and phone bills. That's less than the cost of 10 months of Verizon. If you're looking at other plans, Apple has done an extremely fantastic job of comparing AT&T, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile's myriad plans into a single nice webpage. Google "iPhone Plans Comparison" for the best simple comparison of American big carrier plans. Apple labels these "iPhone Plans" but they are generic smartphone plans that anyone on any compatible device can purchase. (7) Other: Unlike the Nexus 4, USB Hosting OTG works. I personally don't find this that important, considering that OTG is a hassle on a device that's constantly on the move, but it is a big change from the Nexus 4 which didn't apply sufficient voltage to power USB Hosting. If you're wondering what USB Hosting/OTG is, USB Hosting and "On The Go" lets a phone or tablet to plug in a USB device in and let the device via the right program access the storage on the USB device. I'm currently using the Nexus Media Importer (as I previously bought that for the Nexus 7) as it lets me do this without rooting. I was never a big memory user on my Nexus 4, but I know some people are. Google "Meenova" for a more compact design that will let you access MicroSD cards on your Nexus 5. See my picture in the photo gallery. When I first started the phone up, Google play strangely tried to download and install every app I'd previous bought. What gives? I had to manually stop the install of certain apps. Sound quality via headphones is solid, but depends also on the quality of your headphones/earphones. Sound on the speaker is relatively low. Rooting is available now and there are a few ROMs for the Nexus 5 if you wish to play around. Accessories are flooding Amazon as well as eBay for relatively affordable prices. I'm using the¬† [AIR CUSHION] Spigen Google Nexus 5 Case ULTRA HYBRID [Black] [1 FREE Premium Japanese Screen Protector + 2 FREE Graphics] Anti-Scratch Bumper Case with Clear Back Panel for Nexus 5 - ECO-Friendly Package - Black (SGP10609) , but I'm not entirely happy as the flush buttons make it hard to use one handed as opposed to my¬† RINGKE FUSION for Google Nexus 4 Best Selling Shock Absorption Bumper + Anti Scratch Clear Back Premium Hybrid Case [Eco/DIY Pkg.][BLACK ]. Personally, I do love Android. I can simply turn my phone on, look at my lock screen at the Dashclock Widget and see how many texts I have, emails, weather notifications Facebook notifications and so on without having to unlock my phone. I can also turn on GPS, silence my phone, the flash light on and other functions from my lock screen too. The Nexus 5 gives me a great affordable option. (8) Conclusion: The Nexus 5 has some drawbacks, adequate camera, no MicroSD slot, no removable battery and lacking some of Verizon's LTE bands. It does provide a blazing fast processor, roaring graphics chip, an extremely stock version of Android, thin and light design for a very affordable unlocked price. And it's Sprint capable. Android does take some time to learn, but it offers nearly complete customization. For $349 and a dose of willingness to learn, you can't go wrong here. TLDR: Blazing fast smartphone, okay camera, no bloatware, no Verizon, unlocked and just $349~399.|on November 19, 2013|4.0 out of 5 stars
202|I ordered my Nexus 5 soon after it appeared on the Google Play store. In barely a week, I have come to realize just how impressive this device is compared to my 2+ year old Galaxy Nexus! A sharp, vivid, display along with great specs, makes it a great buy at just $350.00 unlocked from the Google Play store. Battery life is decent and build quality over all seems excellent. Buying a phone like this will allow you to stay out of the prison of 2 year contracts!|on November 15, 2013|5.0 out of 5 stars
203|I have been using this phone for a week now and it is fantastic. Best phone I have ever owned and the smoothest implementation of android yet. Phone is designed well and feels solid and high-end in your hand. Unfortunately the plastic backing on the phone is super slippery and is  a disaster waiting to happen. I highly recommend the phone and am looking for a case, which I am normally against.|on November 11, 2013|5.0 out of 5 stars
204|12/21/13 Update: So about 2 weeks ago Nexus 5 users received the 4.4.2 update, it brought many small improvements but the greatest being improving the camera. It shoots very clear shots now, the camera app opens quicker and the camera takes a lot less time to focus. If the camera was something that turned you away from the Nexus 5, then come back because the issue has been fixed. Google says they will keep working on the camera to make it even better.(Stay tuned for any other updates) Original Review: I sold my S3 to get this phone on the Google Play Store and I recommend you do as well (It costs less on the Google Play Store) [...] The total ends up being less than $400 for a smart phone that is priced way to low for what it has to offer. Pricing: $350- 16 GB $400- 32 GB  A Snapdragon 800 Quad-Core Processor clocked at 2.3 Ghz? A Adreno 330 GPU, all these sound to good to be true! Such great specifications at such a low price? But, nothing matters if there is no applicable real world performance, and I'm glad to say that you will be zipping through games and apps! Here are some Pros and Cons: Pros: -Phone feels great in the hand, not to big or not to small -Great Build Quality, better than phones that use plastic like the LG-G2 or S4 (It uses the grippy plastic found on the 2013 Nexus 5) -Buttery Smooth and Fast as Lightning, this phone is that fastest phone I have ever used, hands down -Pure Stock Android (Kit-Kat 4.4) -You get updates as soon as they roll out! No waiting for months to get the next version of android Cons: -Because it only packs a 2300 mh battery, it does ok for daily use, but don't expect to get any crazy battery life, (Standby time is amazing though, it sipped through only a 1% of battery through the whole night!) -Camera is decent, but video quality is great! The mic is the best I have seen on any smart phone, (A software update may improve camera) -Availability, I love this phone, but getting your hands on one can take a bit, but please believe me, it is worth the wait! -Speaker is just all right, it sounds OK but not great Total Scores: Build Quality: 9/10 User Experience: 10/10 Android Kit-Kat (Nexus 5 Experience): 10/10 Camera (Photos): 7/10 Camera (Video): 9/10 Speaker: 7/10 Summery: If you looking for a phone that delivers the best Android Experience, a cheap off contract phone, a phone with great specifications, or just a phone in general, This is the best phone currently on the market. While it has some minor flaws, there is no other phone that offers this much for this little. Total Score: 9/10|on November 10, 2013|5.0 out of 5 stars
205|The Nexus 5 as a whole is one of the best smartphones on the market.  It comes with the latest version of pure android and should always get future upgrades first and has very good hardware specs.  It's kind of like a Galaxy S4 done right.  It doesn't come with all the really bad software Samsung, Carriers and others put on top of android. It is very fast and android 4.4 kitkat adds some nice updates.  The phone itself is rather plain looking, feels great in the hand and has a very nice display.  The ceramic buttons feel premium over the other phones i used.  I think the standout on this device is the specs and the software, which are top notch.  The display, camera and battery life are very good while not being the best on any phone. Everything else about this phone and this phone as a whole package seems to be the best.  I am very happy with it.  I've used the note 2, galaxy s4, nexus 4, iphone 5s and moto x for extended amounts of time.  The only other phone in the group I would consider is the moto x, if u have a preference for something smaller.  But compared to the rest I've used the Nexus 5 is the better choice.|on November 6, 2013|5.0 out of 5 stars
206|Let me first state that my wife recently go the LG G2 which is a fantastic phone; fast, sharp looking screen, etc..  So this is the standard I'm working on.  I got my Nexus 5 and there was zero disappointment.  The Nexus 5 is equally fast and sharp as the G2, in fact, they both share the Qualcom 800 processor which is a real beast.  Using this phone feels like you've got some serious muscle under the hood and it's absolutely true. Nexus 5 comes with stock android so it doesn't have the bells and whistles of many overlaid software that comes standard on your Samsung S4, Lg G2, HTC One, etc.., however, it also lacks all of the unwanted bloatware and you're fully able to build up from stock android to get the perfect amount of software.  For myself, I prefer the look and feel of stock android and so I've been buying Android stock phones since the G1. The phone is very light in my hands but doesn't feel cheap; it feels quite sturdy and the plastic has a nice grip.  Although, I did get it into the¬† SPIGEN Google Nexus 5 Case Slim [Slim Armor] [Champagne Gold] Air Cushioned Protective Case with Dual Layer for Nexus 5 - Champagne Gold (SGP10566) ¬†right away (which is a great case btw). The Kit Kat improvements were expected and I'm equally impressed by;  Google Now is the furthest screen on the left, the icons have a new look; you can now activate "google search" by simply saying "Hey Google".  This "Hey Google" so far gets triggered by my voice as well as others so hopefully I can figure a way for it to listen only to me but that can be dealt with later. Out of the box, the phone only has a couple of home screens available but a quick tip to add more is simply grab an icon and drag it to the upper most right corner of the screen and drop it; that will create a new home screen for you. The only slight annoyance I can provide, at this point, is the ear speaker at the top of the phone; it's white (look at the photo) and so when the phone is off and sitting there I see this white dot which tricks me momentarily into thinking it's an indicator LED saying I have a message or email, etc...  I'm sure I'll get used to this but it's the only thing close to a complaint I can give you at this point. Overall, this is a great purchase and if you're a fan of high end android phones, this won't disappoint you.  I bought mine from Google so paid, with tax, about $423 for the white 32GB model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE *11/8/13 So I just learned I'm supposed to be saying "OK GOOGLE" not "HEY GOOGLE" but they both work.  After several days of use, my only complaint is that the stereo jack is now located back on TOP of the device.  My GNEX had it on the bottom which I preferred.  The phone is still great and performance is stunning.|on November 6, 2013|5.0 out of 5 stars
